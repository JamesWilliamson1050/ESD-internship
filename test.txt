Research and consultancy - a facility for local small businesses to gain from the experience and expertise of those within SBS. You work on two live business consultancy projects (one in each semester) and, as a team of 6, develop solutions and strategic initiatives for the local SME economy.
International experience – only available for students who are undertaking an international exchange for either one semester or full year.
Vertically Integrated Projects - working on a cross-faculty basis to research longitudinal projects (including the ‘Bill Gates Toilet Challenge, Solar Panels for Gambia and Enterprise in Schools) you work with a team of students from all levels of study (first year undergraduate to final year PhD) to further the work of the project.

In addition, you’re required to undertake a social responsibility element (this accounts for one quarter of the overall workload).
These have been designed to provide support to the Curriculum for Excellence and the Widening Access to Higher Education programme. There are no formal classes for MDP3 although there is pathway support with the pathway leads and tutor support.

Business Law
The first-year core Business Law class introduces the main areas of legal study. This includes law-making in the UK Parliament and the devolved Parliament in Scotland, court systems and their decision-making and outlines the law of contract and negligence, which are essential building blocks of all areas of law.

Introduction to Economics
The purpose of this class is to provide you with a balanced introduction to economics which will be at once self-contained and lay the foundation for further study in economics and more generally. The work of the class will be based on a programme of systematic directed reading, supplemented by tutorials, using group projects and in-class short answer tests as cumulative assessment.

Microeconomics 2
This is the core microeconomics class in second year. It aims to develop your understanding of: the concepts of consumer choice; the motives of the firm and profit maximisation; the market and its role in achieving equilibrium prices and quantities; and the implications of market power. It will introduce you to mathematical techniques commonplace in economics, giving you the ability to apply these in a wider economic context.  

Macroeconomics 2
        The class builds upon the macroeconomic foundations established in the first year Economics class and both extends and deepens analysis. In particular this class will develop your ability to use key macroeconomic models and will also provide an introduction to the analysis of economic data.
    
Microeconomics 3
Adam Smith's hidden hand - markets result in efficient outcomes - doesn't always work. We seek to understand why through the study of market power, externalities and public goods, and then go on to apply these ideas to issues of education, healthcare provision and crime and punishment.

Macroeconomics 3
        This class builds on the Macroeconomics you studied in second year by covering four topics in detail: (i) models of economic growth; (ii) the effects of macroeconomic policy in an open economy; (iii) the interrelationships between money growth, output, unemployment and inflation; and (iv) the implications of high government debt.
    
Dissertation 
        The dissertation is an important part of the fourth year programme. Single Honours Economics BA students are required to submit a dissertation in Economics while Joint Honours BA students may submit a dissertation in Economics or in their other Honours subject.
    
Microeconomics 4
Game Theory and Information Economics, the topics of this class, consider market failure resulting from two different sources: individuals pursuing their own self-interest at the expense of others; and information asymmetry which alters the way agents behave. Methods to alleviate these market failures will also be considered.

Macroeconomics 4
This class aims to provide you with the required tools to understand current macroeconomic issues, such as the interactions between the banking sector and monetary policy or the policy responses to the global financial crisis.  Throughout the class, the analytical usefulness of the theoretical models taught is illustrated with real-world examples.

Introduction to Econometrics
This class builds upon the empirical content of Macroeconomics 2 and further develops your ability to analyse economic data. In addition, this class lays the foundations for further study of econometrics at Honours level.

Economics of Firms & Industries 
This class introduces you to different industry structures and studies the behaviour of firms within those structures.  The material builds on the study of the theory of the firm presented in Microeconomics 2 and provides a foundation for the study of industrial organisation at Honours level.

Industrial Economics
        This course investigates the actions that firms in an industry might take to preserve their profit in that industry, and the implications that this has for competition policy and regulation. We take an analytical approach to the issues which will be supported by examining case studies and current events.
    
Applied Econometrics
In the third year econometrics class you’ll have learned about regression in both a cross-sectional data and time series data context. This class extends that knowledge in three ways.
First, for cross-sectional data, the class deals with regression techniques where the dependent variable may be restricted or limited in some way. In such cases, the regression model as taught in the third year class is not appropriate; this class develops models which are similar in spirit to the standard regression model, but can handle all of these cases.
A second purpose of Applied Econometrics is to develop regression methods which can be used when you have panel data - consisting of both cross-sectional and time-series dimensions.
Third, the class will build on the introduction to the econometrics of time series data developed in this class by developing two classes of models.

Financial Development & Economic Growth
This class gives a balanced view of the role of finance in promoting long-run economic growth, but also booms and busts. The nature and role of financial intermediaries will be introduced, and, afterwards, formally addressed in a simple aggregate growth model. Empirical evidence will be examined, before turning to the specifics of micro-finance. The importance of financial globalisation will also be investigated. Finally, the rest of the class will be devoted to deciphering the causes and consequences of the current financial crisis.

Behavioural Economics
Behavioural Economics offers alternative theories that merge psychological insights with economic theory and are based on experimental and other evidence, that attempt to provide a better explanation of real-world behaviour.
This class is concerned with exploring these new behavioural theories with the aim of providing you with an expanded toolkit with which to approach ‘real-world Economics’ that is based on the burgeoning Behavioural Economics literature that has emerged over the past two or three decades.
After studying this, you should be able to extend much of your previously-learned knowledge in Microeconomics in various directions that take into account more realistic ways of modelling how individuals behave.

Natural Resource, Environmental & Energy Economics
The class provides you with an introduction to natural resource, environmental and energy economics and policy. It focuses on the contributions of economics to understanding environmental, energy and resource problems, their causes, and the design of effective public policies to counteract them.

Introduction to Hospitality & Tourism Management
This class introduces you to key issues and concepts in relation to hospitality and tourism management. Gradually you're immersed into the sector and key issues while you apply theories from different fields to the understanding of Hospitality and Tourism. 

Service Encounter Management
In the hospitality and tourism sector, much of the customer engagement and value delivery takes place within the service encounter. In this class you'll learn how the management of this dynamic environment requires an integrated approach where customers, employees and the service setting itself require to be managed.

Destination Marketing Management
Nations, regions and cities: destinations are products for Hospitality and Tourism, inward investment and higher education. You'll explore challenges in managing and marketing destinations across organisational and product boundaries using a range of industry contexts. 

Industry Placement
You have the opportunity to gain experience working with industry professionals, to develop practical skills and reflective practice and to build networks for possible future employment. You'll reflect upon and evaluate not only your own performance, but also the organisation, its output or key activities, and broader social, cultural and economic role.

Events Management
In this class you'll work in a team to design, organise, run and evaluate your own event for charity. Through this practical exercise, you'll be exposed to the realities and challenges of events management and teamwork. This class adds to the experiential content of the Hospitality & Tourism Management programme whilst retaining rigorous theoretical underpinnings and strong coverage of events management at an advanced level.

Internationalisation of Tourism Products and Services
The distinctiveness of this class is based on its specific focus on exploring the international dimension of the hospitality and tourism industry. It brings together insights from International Business and Hospitality & Tourism Management﻿ literatures to explore how the industry has become increasingly global in its operations, and analyse the new type of players that have entered the industry. The class will enhance the current curriculum and educational structure and show developments in terms of internationalisation and the various ways technology is used in necessitating certain changes in the industry.

Hospitality & Tourism Analysis: Case Studies & Case Histories
This class uses case studies from Hospitality & Tourism and challenges aspects of learning in previous classes. It'll further your understanding and appreciation of the nature of hospitality and tourism too. It encourages reflection on some realities of hospitality and tourism which do not fit neatly into theoretical boxes. 

Being an Ethical Manager
The nature and application of business ethics in contemporary management are explored in this class. It raises key ethical issues from both cultural and stakeholder perspectives and balances them with philosophical and pragmatic considerations. It'll provide you with a clear understanding of the dichotomy between philosophical idealism and the pragmatic considerations of ethical leadership for practical management.

Management, Enterprise & the Rise of the Global Economy
Inspired by the Harvard approach to management education this class explores three principles of management:

business strategies are understood through reflection on the complex realities faced by enterprises in competitive arenas
firms can only be understood within the context of market dynamics
the contemporary situation can never be divorced from the past


Strategy & Leadership
This class will develop your knowledge of strategy and provide insights as to how current and aspiring business leaders can manage strategically. You'll have an enhanced understanding of how individuals within an organisation can effectively lead and manage strategy in a complex and challenging world.

Family Business: Theory & Practice
The hospitality and tourism industry has a large number of family businesses. Given the prevalence of family businesses – estimates suggest that almost 80% of new ventures are born as family firms and about 60% of the UK’s 4.2 million enterprises are family firms – graduates employed within the SME sector are likely to be employed by family-owned firms. The class examines the distinctive advantages and unique challenges that face family firms.

Managing People
        In recent years the task of managing employees has been made more challenging by rapid changes in the business environment. This class focuses on the contemporary and practical issues of how people are organised and managed in the workplace and examines theoretical perspectives which help our understanding of the complex relationship between the employer and employee in facilitating the organisation and production of goods and services.
    
Work Psychology
        This class develops understanding of managing people from a psychological perspective through understanding behaviour, attitudes, motivation and wellbeing of people at work. Areas covered include what leads to positive employee work attitudes like job satisfaction, organisational commitment, and their outcomes in terms of work behaviour, such as job performance, withdrawal, absenteeism, turnover, fair treatment and trust.
    
Work Psychology for Human Resource Management
        This class looks at applying psychological theories explaining effectiveness and well-being of people at work to Human Resource Management as an approach to managing people and the employment relationships. Areas covered include organisational and individual decision-making relating to the recruitment and selection process, the impact of performance management on employee perceptions, team working, and the impact of leadership on attitudes and trust.
    
Work, Employment & Society
        This class critically explores changes in the nature of work, employment and society through investigating the extent to which current developments in the workplace can be seen to represent a fundamental shift in the nature of workplace regulation. It'll provide contrasting and complementary perspectives on workplace behaviour to those provided in year 2.
    
Employment Relations
        You'll be introduced to the British system of employment relations, and the general principles, processes and outcomes. It'll consider different theoretical approaches to the study of employment and industrial relations and then examine the role and objectives of trade unions, employers and the state, and their interactions in collective bargaining, employee participation and industrial conflict.
    
Advanced Organisational Behaviour
        This class draws on current themes in work and organisational psychology, and HRM understood from the perspective of micro-organisational behaviour theory and research. It's structured around the concepts of Reframing Organisations and, although the emphasis is on ‘micro’, or individual-level, approaches to organisational behaviour, ‘reframing’ takes into consideration more ‘macro’ or sociological and critical management approaches as well.
    
HRM & Employment Relations in Public Services
The aim of the module is to provide you with a critical understanding of the context and content of ‘New Public Management’ and alternative public management reform strategies. There's particular reference to impacts on HRM and employment relations.
The module will enable you to compare how different countries’ reform trajectories have impacted on changes in HRM and employment relations.

Human Resources in the Global Economy
        This class looks at HRM within a broader understanding of globalization and the international political economy. It places current themes in an international and comparative perspective by analysing and comparing different national ‘models of management’, and a range of employee response to them and, amongst other things, asks questions about the ways in which these management practices are disseminated by multinational companies (MNCs).
    
Perspective on Work & Employment
        This module builds on the year 3 class, Work, Employment and Society, and explores the contribution of social theory to understandings of the contemporary conditions of work and organisations.
    
Introduction to Marketing
Marketing is a key part of any successful business, and a good theoretical and practical knowledge of the subject will be of immense benefit to an aspiring manager or entrepreneur. In this class, you'll be exposed to concepts and ideas from economics, sociology, psychology, geography and other social sciences, all in the context of the competitive business environment.

Understanding Consumers & Markets
Many of the fundamental concepts of marketing are based on an ability to understand consumers and the marketing concept can be implemented more effectively when adequate information about the market and potential consumer behaviour is available. Marketing Research and customer information provide a critical input to the planning and development of a company's marketing strategy in relation to marketing communications, strategic marketing and branding.

Services & Retail Marketing
At the heart of this class is the recognition that services present unique challenges, and that building customer relationships through quality service is fundamental to marketing success in every organisation. Over the past decade the retail sector has been one of the most dynamic areas in business. The retail sector also provides a very clear indication of the overall health and robustness of the economy. The rise or fall of the individual’s disposable income is very quickly reflected in terms of expenditure on items. In this respect, the retail sector acts as the weather vane for the economy.

Marketing Communications in the Digital Age
This class will outline and discuss the strategic role of marketing in a digital context, and further elaborate on the integration of digital marketing, social media marketing, mobile marketing and traditional and digital marketing communications. You will learn about the enduring strategic power of marketing communications in a digital world and learn how to plan for effective, strategic communications which integrate a wide range of channels including the traditional communications mix and the extended mix including all the assets of the brand and digital opportunities.

Strategic Marketing in an International Context
This core class addresses the strategy formulation and planning aspects associated with strategic marketing management as it is applied in domestic and international contexts. The class offers students an analytic decision oriented approach for the development and implementation of international marketing strategy.

Brand Management 
The importance of brands raises significant questions of how to develop brand equity and how to communicate a branding strategy of differentiation, value and identification. The role of the Brand Manager is reviewed along with formulating the necessary communication strategies to build brand equity and secure market share.
More recent approaches in this vein suggest that the traditional Brand Management approach is all too limited, leaving many questions unanswered. Consequently more recent approaches address the co-construction of brand value, through viral branding, using social media, co-branding and brand extensions. In this respect, the principles of branding are now being applied beyond simply new product development, to such strategies as places, communities and countries.
Other key strategies that may be discussed include, luxury branding, nation branding, business-to-business branding and corporate brands.

Social Marketing 
This course aims to build foundational knowledge of traditional commercial-oriented Marketing, by examining applications of Marketing in a social context. Each year millions of pounds are spent world-wide to combat health and social problems such as HIV/AIDS, smoking, drug and alcohol abuse and rising obesity levels. At the same time excessive consumptions burdens society with building landfills and increasing pollution. Meanwhile there are still people who consume 'too little' and who suffer from hunger.
The class considers recent research in a variety of Social Marketing contexts and material is continuously updated to ensure that students gain an understanding of the most relevant and critical Social Marketing trends.

Advances in Consumer Behaviour 
This class provides students with an understanding of some of the contemporary issues and challenges in understanding consumers. Building on the undergraduate Consumer Behaviour class, this module aims to develop students’ ability to analyse consumer behaviour in a variety of situations and to explore the complexity of 21st century consumption.
The class reviews consumer trends and the significance of consumer culture, and then explores topics that are the focus of recent research attention. Current topics include consumer identity (possessions and body image); consumer vulnerability; postmodern consumers; consumer tribes; consumption spaces; consumers and celebrities and consumers and ethics.

Managing Customer Relationships

        The class explores the development of relationship marketing from its transactional roots and introduces concepts such as: CRM, customer loyalty, customer equity and customer perspectives on relationships. A contemporary look at relationships within marketing is introduced through examination of S-D Logic, co-creation and customer engagement, these highlight how firms build and utilise relationships with a customer ‘resource’ to create and offer increasingly more specialised and individualised offerings.
    
International Business Management 
This class examines the theoretical underpinnings which help explain the operations of such enterprises, covering both international business strategy and international business management. This will be achieved by exploring contemporary issues in academic thought and international business practice.

Managing Integrated Marketing Communications: Theory & Practice 
The class will create a learning environment in which students can enhance their knowledge of relevant marketing communications theories and develop the necessary analytical, creative and decision-making skills required to effectively manage IMC in a variety of contexts.

Sports Marketing 
This class provides you with an opportunity to study and apply marketing principles and concepts to a sector that has gained increasing significance in society world-wide. We’ve witnessed the emergence of a sports culture in many countries. This, in turn, has led to the emergence of sport as a global industry.
Sport is one of the most important sectors in the UK in terms of spectator interest, participation and consumer spending. It is also a varied industry consisting of sports products as well as sports services, spectator sports, sports media and sport-related travel.

Small Business Marketing
Given the evolving nature of the job market, evidence suggests that 40% of graduates are now working in 'graduate level' jobs within SMEs. Alongside this, evidence suggests that SME graduate jobs show a concentration towards niche sectors such as marketing. As such, the aim of this class is to provide a theoretical grounding in marketing through the lens of small business organisations.
By focusing on SMEs rather than larger organisations it will provide a contrast with the prevailing focus of marketing and highlight how marketing is different in a small firm and how this translates into SME marketing competencies. Upon completion of this class student will be able to pitch themselves more favourably towards SME employers.

Tourism Marketing
This class explores underlying marketing processes and builds on traditional marketing elements in the context of tourism, considering both supply (destination/ community) and demand (consumer) perspectives. The class will explore a number of theories related to both marketing and tourism, as well of the application of these theories to real world cases, to ensure students gain an enhanced understanding of the tourism industry.

The module is deeply rooted in conceptualisation of children and childhood (James & Prout, 2015) and how our perceptions of the child contribute to our planning and framing of children’s play experiences. By developing a relational approach to understanding what it feels like to be a child in the learning context, students will be able to analyse the competences of children as directors of their own learning in a free play context. Thus, the module is unpinned by the following themes: - The agentic role of the child as part of a pedagogic culture; - Spaces and places for child-centeredness in children’s lives and learning.

Promoting Playful Pedagogies in Practice
This module will investigate the significance of play to children’s thinking and to the development of positive learning dispositions for children of all ages. The ways in which pedagogical practices shape the play experiences of children in a variety of settings will be explored. It is vital that those who work with children understand the principles and values which underpin their work. The module will provide a professional, theoretical context in which to formalise and extend existing good practice as well as to develop new, innovative practice in supporting children’s active learning. Students will be encouraged to interrogate “accepted” practice in light of their reading, theoretical perspectives explored and discussion with their peers.

Leadership and Management in Childhood Practice
This module will explore the relationship between leadership, management and quality. It will encourage students to assess their own knowledge skills and abilities and to look at the ways in which they can support and foster the development of leadership in others within their establishment teams.

Implementing Curriculum in Practice
This module aims to strengthen students’ knowledge of pedagogy, pedagogical approaches and key subject knowledge in relation to health and wellbeing, literacy and numeracy. Consideration will be given to the way that subject knowledge, curriculum and child’s own experiences and interest’s influence how professionals lead pedagogy and curriculum whilst remaining true to the voice of the child. This module builds on course expectations that participants will critically analyse current practice in light of new and growing evidence from theory and policy.

Leading Pedagogy and the curriculum 
This module will draw on relevant theories to strengthen students’ knowledge of pedagogy, pedagogical approaches and key subject knowledge in relation to health & wellbeing, literacy and numeracy. Consideration will be given to the way that subject knowledge, curriculum and child’s own experiences and interest’s influences how professionals lead pedagogy and curriculum whilst remaining true to the voice of the child.

Leading and developing the professional self
While this module links to previous modules in the degree on leadership and management of quality and pedagogy, it is distinctive in its focus upon the leader’s self-management within the childhood practice sector. They will look at theory and practice of interpersonal and self-management skills that they require to fulfil a management role effectively. The module will also build upon personal development review practice commenced in Year 1 to reflect on their growing professional impact over the degree.

Understanding Education in the 21st Century
This class introduces students to a large and rich seam of disciplinary knowledge. It is an introductory class of potential interest to all who want to understand more about Education. Some of the key content to be addressed in the module is around the following:

the field of study that is education: what it is and how we know that
the context of education: some contribution of political, historical and economic dimensions to curriculum, schooling, policy, globalisation
education achievement: some contributions of psychological, sociological and philosophical perspectives to topics such as learning, diversity, gender


Placement & Curriculum
In this class, students from different disciplines work together to learn about children and the communities in which they live; children's health and wellbeing; child protection; children's voice; children's play and play places. The notion that the health and wellbeing of children and young people is central to the advancement of society is a seminal theme in this module. 
The placement experience has been designed to allow students to undertake a work placement with children and young people from 0 - 14 years. Placements will be provided in a range of settings outwith the mainstream classroom.

Learners & Learning
        This class provides students with an essential understanding of human learning processes and the needs of learners across the life-course.
    
Informal Education
        This class investigates philosophical and pedagogical interventions beyond the school curriculum in informal settings, with adults in particular. It'll also open up possibilities for informal education techniques and practices to be considered and adopted by a range of professions and to explore potential partnerships between informal education specialists and others.
    
History & Philosophy of Education
This class will support students in developing their knowledge and understanding of the roots of some key educational ideas in history. These will be considered from a philosophical perspective.

Children & Childhood
This class will focus on children and childhood in contexts other than formal education settings that will be explored elsewhere. It will introduce students to the concepts of child and childhood through a range representations and will draw on children in film, art and literature to explore representations of children and childhood and experiences of childhood.

Social Pedagogy with Adults
This class is based on an understanding of the evolution of adult learning and the resultant principles that underline current practice and will illustrate how adult educators work and will also open up possibilities for adult education techniques and practices to be considered. It'll also explore potential partnerships between adult educators and others.

Policy & Politics in Education
This class will provide students with the opportunity to engage in debate about current issues in education through detailed exploration of the policy and political contexts. It will introduce students to frameworks for understanding how policy comes about and how it is inextricably linked with political issues.

Social Issues in Education
This class will teach students about the responsibility of teachers for the education, health and well-being of all children, in the context of a complex and diverse society. It will also address the needs of those who will work with children, young people and adults in a variety of education-related contexts through its focus on a range of key social issues and the relevant national legislative and policy framework.

Social Research Methods (10-credit class)
This class prepares students for designing and completing a research project. It will equip students with the skills and knowledge required in planning and delivering a research project.

English 1A & 1B
These first-year classes offer an introduction to the study of English at university level.
In the course of these classes you will study a range of texts in the three main genres of creative literature - poetry, prose, and drama – and will learn to engage with the critical materials that analyse them, and have the option in assessment to respond creatively to some of these work as well.
Across this year you will also have an opportunity to understand how particular historical and social contexts shape literature, and to discuss ways in which historical literature continues to live and have relevance to the contemporary reader. Current texts studied in this class include Othello, Robinson Crusoe, Jane Eyre, and some contemporary song lyrics and Renaissance poetry.

Writing Through Time 1&2
These classes develop your understanding of literary criticism from our first-year classes by engaging with the question of the historical situatedness of literary production, offering an overview of key ideas, debates and literary texts from the Renaissance to the present. Once again our focus is on different genres of writing: this time, poetry, drama, and long and short prose fiction. Through these texts, you will engage with distinct modes of analysis, with literary critical approaches sitting alongside more innovative creative approaches.

The Construction of Scotland
This class offers a wide variety of ways of thinking about 'Scottishness' and Scottish national identity. The main aim of the class it to challenge assumptions of national identity as something that is coherent and fixed by exploring the many complexities, subtleties, and contradictions in Scottish identity. Focusing on issues of language, gender, and place, the class will encourage students to deepen their understanding of 'Scottishness' and the constructed nature of national identity through a literary and cultural lens.

TextLab
Textlab is one of several Vertically Integrated Projects (ViPs) running across the University. Each ViP brings together a team of undergraduates, postgraduates, and staff to work on a research-based project.
TextLab brings together students and staff from English/Humanities and Computer and Information Science. We work on research projects in the field of Digital Humanities (the application of computer-based technologies to the study of texts) – specifically using computers to analyse Shakespeare’s language, and building a website aimed at schools.

Making the Modern Human 
The class aims to introduce you to changing ideas about the human in relation to two key moments in history: the concept of the idea of the beast within from the age of Shakespeare, and the emergence of Darwin's theory of evolution in the mid-nineteenth century. The class will look at shifts in understanding the boundary between humans and animals and at what that meant for how people understood themselves at two very different moments in the past. Core to the class will be how scientific, philosophical and literary materials contemplate the same ideas.

Detective Fiction
This course will trace the development of crime fiction from the mid C19th until the present day. Beginning with some of the earliest depictions, we will examine short stories by Edgar Allen Poe and Arthur Conan Doyle, before going on to look at C20th representations of the literary sleuth in Britain and the USA. We will consider well-known examples from popular culture (eg Hercule Poirot and his 'little grey cells', the stereotype of the American private-eye) as well as more experimental, postmodern examples (Thomas Pynchon’s The Crying of Lot 49 and Paul Auster's New York Trilogy).
Throughout the course we will be concerned with connections between crime and the emergence of the modern city, questioning the extent to which detective fiction aims to impose a sense of rationality and closure on an otherwise uncertain and alienating world. In its concern with the social and cultural role of crime fiction, this course will also reflect on the importance of deconstructive, feminist, post-structuralist and psychoanalytic readings of the genre.

Greek Theatre to National Theatre 
This class is designed to introduce students to theatre practice starting with Greek theatre through to the work of the National Theatre for Scotland. The sessions are designed to be both theoretical and practical with students engaging with activities that illuminate the textual material studied. Drama was intended to be performed and to this end, study will also include that of set design and how that has evolved over the centuries taking into account the changes in style and expectations of an audience as well as the harnessing of technological advances.
Students will study in two-hour sessions to allow the theoretical underpinning to be embedded into the workshop activities and should be considered as a foundation for future study in theatre practice. The intention is to study a selection of plays, not as isolated written works, but in relation to their production and performance.
The class will give students insights into evolving theatre practices, predominately in Europe, through examination and analysis of dramatic fiction and their theatrical constructs. The class will draw upon the work of playwrights that will include Euripides, Shakespeare, Moliere, Pirandello, Chekov, Brecht, Beckett, Pinter, and Greig and examine the professional practice of contemporary theatre performers and directors. The class will work alongside practice-based research on the communication of dramatic fiction through theatrical performance.

International Influences
This class teaches you how various kinds of world literature have been influential on literature in English. Each week the lecture introduces a new literature, sometimes referring to one or two specific authors, and places the foreign literature linguistically, culturally and historically. We then look at specific influences on writers in English. Sometimes we will look at translations, sometimes adaptations, including into different media, and we will see that texts can lead to other texts through complex chains of influence.
Seminars often take a foreign text, and look at one or more English language variants of it.  One of the assessments is an essay involving analysis of adapted texts; the other is an essay on the more general issues which arise. Students are not expected to learn or know about any of the foreign languages involved.
Topics for 2019-20 are likely to be similar to those for the current year, which includes Sappho and Homer (Greek), Catullus (Latin), Dante and Petrarch (Italian), the Hebrew Bible, Borges (and other Latin Americans), Chinese and Japanese poetry, Scottish Gaelic, Indian and other South Asian literature, and Scandinavian (including Old English) literature.
 

Language in Business
This class explores the ways in which language is used in businesses and other organisations (including charities, government, education, etc.). The class also functions as an introduction to the theory of communication more generally; we explore how meaning is communicated, how texts are made coherent, why speaking is a way of acting, how conversations are structured, and how politeness is managed.
We consider gender as an aspect of organisations, and how language maintains and constructs gender. We look at the use and invention of words (eg brand names), including organisational metaphors and the use of storytelling in an organisation. We consider how language and communication differ across cultures, and how this can lead to cross-cultural misunderstanding, and we ask whether different languages shape different ways of thinking; as part of this, we consider the discourses of banal nationalism.
The materials we study may include websites, values statements, marketing brochures and posters, public apologies, political speeches, transcripts of e-mail interactions, and of meetings. One of the assessments is an essay involving analysis of one of these kinds of organisational discourse; the other is an essay on the more general issues which arise. Students are not expected to have any prior knowledge of linguistics or the analysis of language.
 

Reading Poetry
This class will examine the tools of poetry, including voice, rhyme, meter, schemes, and tropes, in a variety of genres and periods. The aim of this course is to introduce students to the conventions of poetry and the ways in which these conventions have been subverted or modified over time, allowing for innovation and introducing new voices, such as those of women, minorities and the working classes.
We will consider a number of poetic forms, such as the sonnet, the lyric, the epic, and the ode, with examples taken from the early modern to the present day. The principal aim of the class is to give students the tools required to read poetry with confidence.
The course will cover the sonnet, sonnet sequences, lyric poetry, dramatic monologues, narrative poetry, epic, satire, ekphrasis, and odes and elegies, and a wide range of authors including Donne, Pope, Byron, Christina Rossetti, Tennyson, Dickinson, Poe, Siddal, Rilke, Plath, Angelou, and Atwood.

Sex, Revenge & Corruption in Renaissance Drama
This class will focus on drama, a key genre in the period from the 1580s to the closure of the playhouses in 1642. Reading work by major dramatists such as William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, Ben Jonson and Thomas Middleton, we will engage with a form that addressed both a highly literate and a popular audience, and is thus a particularly interesting place to trace ways of thinking in the period.
The common thread that ties this selection of plays together is their interest in transgression: what happens when humans cross the limits set by tradition, religion and the state? In the process of this theatrical interrogation, the plays pose questions about violence, identity, gender, desire, citizenship and the role of the theatre itself. We will read tragedies and comedies, and wonder why tragedies in this period are so often comic, and why the comedies end badly.

Theories of Literature & Wellbeing
The relationship between literature and wellbeing is of interest to the a number of employers and professions, including health and social care (evidenced by the journal Medical Humanities and the 'Get into Reading' programme run by The Reader, a charity). However investigations into the potential benefits of reading or hearing literature are hampered at the moment by the lack of a theoretical base from which to start. Academic work in English and literature is growing more interdisciplinary with sustained interest in the psychology of the reading experience for example.
This class combines recent academic research with the needs and interests of students to assess a number of theories which relate literature to wellbeing. It also encourages students to reflect on their own experiences as students, readers and critics of literature. Students with an interest in arts therapy may find the class a useful part of their degree, as well students considering teaching English or working in libraries, arts organisations or social care.
The class will also provide a new avenue for literary investigation for students who may be considering going on to do interdisciplinary research. The learning outcomes will differ from learning objectives insofar as they focus on broader cognitive abilities, non-subject specific skills or graduate attributes.

improved ability to understand what a theory is and how it can be evaluated
enhancement of skills taught in other English classes, such as textual analysis, argumentation, group discussion etc


Writing War
This class explores the literature of conflict in the 20th and 21st centuries, from the First World War to the Iraq War. The class treats war as a complex cultural phenomenon rather than a simple military activity, and as such we explore not only the literature of combat but also a range of texts.

Writing Short Fiction & Poetry 
This core class will introduce creative writing students to two key genres: short fiction and poetry. Taught in workshop sessions by practising creative writers this will be a practice led class. On it, students will develop good practice related to the professional presentation of creative work, and will be introduced to the skills involved in reflecting critically on creative products and processes.
The class will build on the basic writing techniques that students have developed in their first and second year of study such as: point of view, characterisation, setting, dialogue and narrative structure. The class will also encourage and expect a more advanced and discerning set of reading skills. Looking at a wide range of material such as novels, short stories and poems the class will examine a range of different narrative strategies, contexts and approaches and use these as stimuli for creative work.

Dramatic Writing 
This class will be based around a selection of screen and radio scripts that have formed the basis for dramatic works such as: The Graduate, Mad Men, Bladerunner, The True Story of Bonnie Parker and When Harry Met Sally and will introduce key concepts in the theory and practice of creative writing as these emerge in the context of writing for radio and screen.
Students will write dramatic scripts that demonstrate a good awareness of skills and techniques relevant to the genre, develop good practice related to the professional presentation of creative work, and be introduced to the skills involved in reflecting critically on creative products and processes. The class will be taught by practising creative writers.

Creative Economies & Culture Industry
This Honours option will explore how 'creative economies' operate in the twenty-first century, using a focus on local industries to investigate global issues and challenges. It will enable students to understand how the concepts of 'creative economy', 'cultural industry' or 'creative industries' developed, and explore the controversies which have often surrounded these terms.

Literature, Mind & Brain
This class responds to developments in literary research which are drawing on findings in cognitive science. A number of PhDs and postdoctoral researchers, as well as more experienced literary scholars, are using these findings to ask questions about the nature of literary experience in general, and the nature of specific literary texts in particular. In addition, the class responds to the increasing demand for interdisciplinary skills for humanities students. This is likely to appeal to honours English students who wish to bridge the gap between the critical analysis of texts and the rapidly changing model of human cognition emerging from psychology, neuroscience and philosophy.
The class will combine a weekly reading of a scientific or philosophical article with a short literary text and consider the implications of and/or problems with the article in the light of the literary text. No class of this kind is currently on offer at Strathclyde.

The 1930s: Literature & Culture
The 1930s is a period of cultural and political instability that is dominated by the inequalities between rich and poor, by problems with employment and housing, and by an insecure international situation in which the United Kingdom is increasingly isolated from developments in continental Europe. Into this conflict come authoritarian populist politicians intent on restoring strong leadership and the restoration of past national glories, and on the other side coalitions of the liberal left seeking a new politics to resist such authoritarian thinking. It is a period, in other words, strikingly like our own.
In taking the class you will gain an understanding of the distinctive concerns of the literature and wider culture of the 1930s. We will pay particular attention to formal questions that dominate the decade’s literature - those of documentary, realism, and the legacy of Modernism - as well as to thematic issues of class division and national identity, urbanisation, and domestic politics.  You will also gain an understanding of the relationship between literature and other forms of cultural production in the period, particularly journalism and documentary cinema.
By taking part in the class you will develop your abilities in close critical reading of literary texts and will gain further experience of independent learning and essay and examination writing.

Sixties Britain: Literature, Culture, Counterculture
The 1960s are often thought of as the decade of hedonism, hippies, free love and The Beatles. Yet the sixties were also a time of deep political unrest and activism, during which political movements for civil rights, anti-war and women’s liberation gained momentum. In addition, the 1960s were a decade of important technological advancements (including the introduction of colour television and developments in space exploration) which would have a fundamental effect on culture in Britain and beyond. This aim of this class, therefore, is to explore the legacy of the 1960s, its representation through a variety of key literary, cultural and critical texts.
Beginning with an examination of British culture through a literary lens in the late 1950s, it goes on to explore the central tensions of the decade. In doing so, students will engage with a variety of classic texts of the period, examining the 1960s in terms of culture vs counterculture, class, race and gender, reflecting on just how controversial the decade actually was.

Songs: music & literature
This class looks at songs of different kinds. We ask what makes songs both similar to, and different from, poems. We explore how words are fitted to musical structures, including rhythms and tunes. We examine how poems are set to music, or otherwise accompanied by music; we consider the difference between poetic and musical metre, and the use of rhyme. We explore different kinds of singing style.  We examine why songs give us strong emotional experiences.
We consider the difference between high and low cultures in songs, and the borrowing of songs between genres. We consider the role of songs in constructing identity, including national identity. We consider popular and rock songs, folk songs, and classical songs; in addition we will look at some overseas song traditions (eg Chinese, Australian Aboriginal).
One of the assessments is an essay involving analysis of a song which you choose yourself; the other is an essay on the more general issues which arise.
Students are not expected to have any prior knowledge of music or linguistics, or musical ability.

Soviet Literature: 1917-1967
This class looks at three key moments in the history of the Soviet Union, and explores how political contexts radically different from those in western Europe affected the way literature was written and interpreted.
All texts are in English, translated from Russian. The Russian Revolution in 1917 happened at a moment of intense experimentation in literature across Europe. In the early revolutionary years, many Soviet writers of the avant garde explored the possibility of experimental writing which could both reach the masses and help to bring about social change. We will look at both the literary theory and some of the experimental texts from this period, including a film. In the 1930s, during Stalin's rule, this revolutionary approach was sidelined by a top down emphasis on 'Soviet socialist realism', fiction that is easily accessible and offers a vision of a brighter future for a population living through unprecedented change. We will look at three of these Socialist Realist novels and appraise how far they conformed with the ambitions of the state, as well as considering the nature of literary realism itself.
Finally, we will consider literature by dissidents, writers who increasingly challenged the Communist regime in the 'Thaw' that followed Stalin's death in 1953, looking at novels by two dissident writers, including Boris Pasternak's Dr Zhivago.

Victorian Gothic
This class will examine the development of the Gothic tradition in a diverse selection of Victorian texts which will include works by the Brontes, Bram Stoker, H. G. Wells, Oscar Wilde and Arthur Conan Doyle.
The aims of the course are twofold. Firstly, we will consider the literary origins and devices of Gothic in the popular novels and short stories of the Romantic period (eg Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein), and trace the ways in which major Victorian authors modified them, paying attention to questions such as genre and inter-textuality. However, these textual studies will continually be placed within a broader historical and social context: the principal aim of the class is to assess how an understanding of the fascination of the Gothic mode for Victorian authors can be used as a tool for exploring the complexities of nineteenth-century society.
We will use the texts to consider issues such as urbanisation, scientific progress, religious crisis, Empire, new forms of communications technology and print culture, the ‘New Woman’, deviant sexualities, degeneration, decadence and the fin-de-siècle.
Throughout, the texts will be read ‘against the grain’ by employing a range of critical terminology (such as Freud’s work on dreams or recent work on ‘female Gothic’).

Wild in the Renaissance
The concept of 'the wild' is one that emerges in many different ways in the writings of the Renaissance; in relation to self-cultivation (holding back the wildness within), the control of one's world (taming the ever-present wilderness); and in relations with fellow humans in a changing world (in savage domination). These ideas get played out in numerous ways in the period - from poetic use of the symbolic resonance of gardens and gardening; the religious underpinnings of the 'missionary endeavour' in the New World and what that says about the concept of human nature; to the anxious self-examination of humanity's inevitable sinfulness.
This class will thus introduce you to key canonical texts from the period – plays, poetry, and court masques – by writers including Shakespeare, Jonson, and Milton, and will also engage with a critical and theoretical debates about the relationships between humans and the natural world from the new fields of animal studies and ecocriticism.

The Glasgow Novel
This class will trace the development of fictional representations of Glasgow from the beginnings of industrialism to the present age. In doing so, it will consider a wide variety of historical and literary approaches to depicting the city. Beginning with a brief history of the pre-C20th Glasgow novel, the course goes on to consider some of the most famous literary depictions of Glasgow, including McArthur and Long’s No Mean City, Archie Hind’s The Dear Green Place and Alasdair Gray’s Lanark.

New Narratives
The publishing world is changing rapidly with the advent of digital publishing and the ebook. This class will enable students to explore new possibilities and write for new markets and platforms. It will also look at skills that students need for a career in both traditional and digital publication such as editing, submitting work and performing/reading work in front of an audience.
This class aims to hone the skills students have acquired in previous years to produce new work for print, performance and for a range of digital platforms. It will also provide an up-to-date examination of the publishing world and will include reflective element.

The Power of Underlying Material: Adaptation, book to film & beyond
This class is an elective option in fourth year English that encourages students to look at the layering process involved in adapting a piece of underlying material either for literature or for the screen. We will examine a comprehensive range of source texts that inform many literary works and much of the screen drama available in the late 20th century and, in particular, in the current marketplace.
The class will complement the third year core class in Creative Writing, and will also be useful to those undertaking honours dissertations in Creative Writing. As well as exercises in close reading, and theoretical analysis, the class will emphasise the commercial realities of basing work on underlying material.

Contemporary Travel Writing
This class engages with some of the key tensions in contemporary travel writing from race and sexuality, to issues of cultural stereotyping and ‘foreignness’. By working through a series of international case studies ranging from India to North America, the class will address why travel continues to be an important metaphor for thinking about our experience of the world, as well as offering a framework for how we understand it.

Forms of Feminism in Contemporary Literature
The class will explore how feminist concerns are represented in contemporary literature, and how literary forms shape contemporary feminism. Students will encounter some of the most important literary works of the post-1990 period, and learn to make connections between literary analysis and feminist theory. Engaging with a diverse range of literary forms—from novels, poems and plays to comics and manifestos—students will leave the course with an advanced understanding of the role literature plays in contemporary feminist politics.

Le Monde du Travail
Cultural focus: time (35 hour week, RTT and ‘ponts’, paternity/maternity leave, …) & ‘human resources’ (hierarchical organisation, discrimination, unions, relocation,…)

Year abroad
        This is the year abroad, spent either studying at a foreign university or working as a language assistant or on a work placement. This year is compulsory to gain entry into Honours.

History 1A
This class focuses on the history of the British Isles from 1700 to 1914. It was a period of phenomenal change in terms of who ruled the country, the main economic activities, emerging cultural expression and attitudes and the growth of British power overseas on an unprecedented scale.
In the class we'll use the British Isles as a historical 'laboratory' to discuss key themes that have shaped the modern world.
We'll look at:

the formation of the British state
the ideas that were shaped by the Enlightenment, in which Scottish writers played an important part
why Britain industrialised and Ireland did not
the often dire social consequences of industrialisation
how and why Britain created the Empire
the growth of British overseas trade will be looked at
the impact of Britain on Asian, African and American societies
the ideological effects of the American War of Independence, the French Revolution and the 1798 rebellion in Ireland
the meaning of Victorian values in Scotland and the development of modern political parties and the growth of democracy
the roles of gender and class in shaping modern British and Irish society

This class will enable students to understand the origins of both modern British society and the beginnings of an increasingly integrated global community. In the tutorials, each meeting will involve the examination of a key document or two, as well as a discussion of that week's topic.
    
History 1B
This class follows on from History 1A and takes the story up to the end of the 20th century. We'll look at:

the effects of World War I on Scottish society and why Ireland broke away from the United Kingdom
the growth of the Labour Party and the rise of socialism will be traced
the effects of the Great Depression of the 1930s on British society
the reasons why the British government formulated a policy of appeasement, to show how foreign policy and domestic policy were inextricably linked
the impact of World War II on British society
the demands that led to the creation of the Welfare State will be explored
the new international realities facing Britain in 1945
the beginnings of the Cold War, to show how effectively Britain adapted to the loss of Great Power status
post-war society and the cultural revolution of the "Swinging Sixties". We'll ask whether a generation gap emerged
the long slow march of women's rights
the impact of immigration, to show the ways in which British society was changing fundamentally
the collapse of the traditional industrial economy in the 1980s and changes in Scottish family life, to show how social norms were being overturned
the advent and effects of devolution in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland

Just as in the first semester History class, we will use carefully selected documents in tutorials to help us analyse each topic.

Placement and Curriculum
On this module, students from across disciplines work together to learn about children and the communities in which they live; children's health and wellbeing; child protection; children's voice; children's play and play places. The notion that the health and wellbeing of children and young people is central to the advancement of society is a seminal theme in this module. 
The placement experience has been designed to allow students to undertake a work placement with children and young people from 0 - 14 years.  Placements will be provided in a range of settings outwith the mainstream classroom.

Scotland: Renaissance and Reformation
This course will focus on the period from the final establishment of the territorial boundaries of the Scottish kingdom in James III’s reign through to the Union of Crowns in 1603. In covering the era of the Renaissance and Reformation in Scotland, as well as the regnal union of 1603, it will focus on the reigns of successive Stewart monarchs and their subsequent accession to the English and Irish thrones, thereby creating a British imperial monarchy.
Scotland’s contact with Europe and its strained relations with England form core themes but political history will be studied in the light of the social, religious, economic and cultural developments that lend early-modern Scotland its distinct identity, thereby examining issues such as trade and economic development, the impact of the Renaissance in Scotland, literacy and the spread of reforming ideas, the arts, education and issues of identity.

Disease & Society
This class provides a broad introduction to the historical relationship between diseases and human societies in the early modern and modern periods.
It examines the core thesis that diseases and other health conditions have had dramatic impacts on history, shaping economic relations, political and social structures and cultural and religious beliefs.  However, it also explores the reverse of this, the thesis that human activities, ideas and behaviours have radically altered the diseases and conditions that afflict our societies over the last five hundred years.
The course is grouped around three themes:

infectious disease
chronic disease
society's responses to disease

Lectures in the first two sections focus on exploring the origins of key diseases/debilities, the ways in which social structures/behaviours have caused or abetted these conditions, and their impacts on society, economics, politics and culture.
In the final section, lectures focus more on the ways in which societies have sought to conceptualise, control and cure diseases. The key questions that students should be able to answer by the end is how have diseases and debilities shaped human societies, and how have human societies shaped diseases and debilities?

History of Scotland 1700-1832
This course will explore Scotland’s political, economic, religious, intellectual and social development in the aftermath of the Union of 1707 through to 1832.  The benefits, disadvantages and tensions that arose from the process of becoming part of the British state will be explored through such issues as:

causes and impact of union
the significance of Jacobitism
the nature and consequence of agricultural and industrial change
Empire
the role of the Scottish Enlightenment.


Modern Europe
This class examines some of the principal developments in international history of twentieth century Europe. It pays particular attention to:

the causes of the First World War
the impact of the war upon the international system
the rise of new powers within the international community after 1919
the causes of the Second World War
the Cold War and the forces driving European integration since 1945
the role of the USA and USSR in recent European history

In terms of geographical coverage the class will seek to balance consideration of Europe-wide developments with finer-focus treatment of French, Italian and German history. The class will introduce students to some of the main debates in the academic literature and encourage them to look at a range of relevant primary sources.

Oral History: Theory and Practice
Please note that this is compulsory for students who wish to use oral history in their dissertation.
Oral history is a way of engaging with the past via the experiences and memories of those who were there. ‘Oral history’ is a multifaceted term that refers to the sources (interviews), the methodology (interviewing), theory (analysis), and products (of which there are many).
This new class aims to alert students to the possibilities of using oral history as a way of understanding the past. It will examine key concepts and methodologies in oral history and explore how oral history has helped to shape historical understanding.
This class also has an important practice-based focus – students taking the class will gain an opportunity to develop practical skills in oral history interviewing and analysis as well as to reflect critically on theory in relation to practice. They will also get an opportunity to explore the application and use of history in the public arena through engaging with work on oral history and public history.
Because of the practical nature of this class and the limited supply of equipment, numbers are capped at 25.

Cold War Europe

Disability in Modern Britain
The aim of this class is for to gain an understanding of the key role that disability plays in the study of the historical past.
The class will explore the ways in which disability has been defined, treated and experienced. It will place developments in disability policy within wider social, cultural and political contexts. Students will engage with, and think critically about, primary sources ranging from official papers, newspaper articles, and oral testimonies, in addition to relevant secondary source material.
The use of oral testimonies in particular will help students to consider the lived experiences of disabled people and the ways in which society sought to define and treat disability. 

Medicine & Warfare
This class explores the role that health and medicine has played in the major wars of the twentieth century. In particular, it considers the vital contribution that medicine has made to manpower economy, discipline and morale.
Focusing predominantly on Britain, the USA and Europe, the class analyses the ways that different countries have responded to the medical issues posed by modern warfare in both military and civilian contexts. As such, it considers issues such as wartime disability, welfare provision, occupational health and psychiatry, and explores the role that military doctors, women and humanitarian organisations have played in shaping medical responses to war.
The key objective of this class is to place military-medical developments within their wider social, cultural and political contexts and to examine the impact of military health and medicine on the lived experience of war.

France at War
The class begins with the traumatic episodes of the Franco-Prussian War and the Communes of 1871. By analysing the often problematic political and cultural consolidation of the Third Republic, this class will explore the ‘culture wars’ and the internal divisions that culminated in the Dreyfus Affair. After the humiliation of losing its status as Europe’s dominant power, France sought greatness in colonial expansion in Africa and Indochina, while seeking to consolidate national identity by transforming ‘peasants into Frenchmen’.
You'll explore the experiences of the First World War, assessing the strength of French unity in the face of the German enemy. The interwar clashes between fascism and the Popular Front will then be examined and how the First World War impacted upon French foreign policy and attitudes towards future war.
You'll spend three weeks exploring the enduring controversies of the Second World War, focusing upon the collapse, resistance, collaboration, and French involvement in the persecution of the Jews, as France faced its ‘hereditary enemy’ once again.
The class concludes with an analysis of the French withdrawal from Indochina and Algeria and an assessment of France’s position in the post-war global order.
A variety of sources will be explored throughout the class, including paintings, monuments, films, literary sources, newspaper reports, memoirs and archival documents. 

Propaganda & War in the Twentieth Century
This class examines means by which states conduct informal activities to promote their domestic and foreign objectives during wartime. In particular, it analyses the role of propaganda throughout the twentieth century, focusing on the use of modern mass communication and technology by states involved in conflicts.
The class is structured around a number of historical themes, which help shed light on the emergence of propaganda as an important means of modern warfare. Key themes analysed throughout the course include:

the First World War as the first ‘total war’
the growth of international radio broadcasting
the creation of centralised propaganda machines in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union
home-front propaganda during the Second World War
propaganda, disinformation and the Cold War
the United States and the experience of Vietnam
information, media coverage and the Gulf War
9/11 and the war on terrorism

During seminars, students will be exposed to relevant primary source material. Particular attention will be given to understanding the theory and practice of propaganda and analysing how technological developments have contributed to shaping modern information and mass persuasion.

Historiography
This class is compulsory for students who want to study history at Honours level.﻿
This class will introduce students to the methods used by historians to reconstruct the past, exploring and analysing the techniques used by historians in doing primary research. The class is designed to demonstrate how students can use these techniques in their own work, particularly their 4th year/Honours dissertation.
Among the topics that will be covered are:

constructing bibliographies
using evidence
using academic conventions
constructing research plans
writing historical prose

The class will also introduce students to the subject of historiography – the history of history – and the ways in which our understanding and construction of history has evolved. The class is designed to promote independent learning and encourage students to reflect more deeply on the subject matter.
    
Madness and Society

Genocide in the 20th Century
The objectives of this class include introducing students to recent examples of genocide and related mass atrocities, and writing and thinking about these cases in a critical and engaged manner through analysis of primary and secondary materials.
Students will be introduced to historical, sociological, anthropological, and legal perspectives related to the occurrence of genocide and related atrocity crimes. Using case studies from the 20th century, we'll discuss:

contemporary issues related to the labelling of cases
the evolution of international legal, diplomatic, economic and military measures to prevent, interdict and punish atrocity crimes
the phenomenon of genocide denial
the politics of commemoration
the lingering legacies of violence on individuals and communities in the post-genocide period

Case studies will include clear-cut (recognized in international humanitarian law) examples of genocide, including:

the Armenian genocide
the Holocaust in Nazi-occupied Europe
the 1994 Rwandan genocide

Less clear-cut examples will also be looked at, such as:

Canada’s Residential School System
Stalinist crimes in Soviet Russia
Khmer Rouge atrocities in Cambodia
the scorched earth policies in Guatemala
ethnic cleansing surrounding the Bosnian War.


Society and Politics in Colonial India: 1880s-1947
This class will cover the political developments and social groups from the late-nineteenth century till the decolonisation of South Asia in 1947.
This is a key period in the social and political history of modern South Asia as it witnessed the growth of a mass-based anti-colonial struggle.  Simultaneously, the involvement of different social groups in this process led to the emergence of community and caste based identity politics.  Under pressure from demands for independence, the colonial state initiated a process of phased devolution of power, and decolonisation after the Second World War.  The class will compare these developments to raise questions about the 'modernity' of colonial society and polity.  The class will analyse how different social groups - such as the peasantry, the working class and tribal groups - participated in and shaped political movements in South Asia.
Students will also be encouraged to use the regional perspective of South Asian history to understand the different expressions of class, gender and ethnicity in non-Western societies.

Scotland’s Highland Problem
Historiography had tended to isolate Highland history from Scottish political development during the late medieval and early modern periods.  This class will re-address this trend, emphasising the Highlands as an integral part of Scottish society, at the same time exploring the division within Scotland between the ‘barbaric’ Highlands and the ‘civil’ Lowlands.
Students will study the nature and structure of clan society and place Highland events within the wider context of national and British politics during the sixteenth century.  While relations between the Scottish crown and its Highland subjects is the key theme of this class, students will analyse the extent to which such relations changed through time, and why.
The class will also highlight divergent policies within clan society itself, a factor which warns against treating the Highlands as a homogenous whole, instead taking into consideration regional, local and personal biases.  

Scottish Society since 1914
The class provides a broad survey of Scottish social history since 1914. The aim of this class is to explore the nature and development of Scottish society in the twentieth century by assessing the impact of industrialisation and the problems associated with de-industrialisation, as well as the development of an urban society.
By the end, the successful student should have expanded their knowledge of contemporary Scottish history and have a good idea of the diversity of issues, techniques and arguments which historians have deployed in the study of twentieth-century Scotland. Among the themes to be covered are:

the extent to which Scotland had a recognisable culture and identity
the myths and realities of 'Red Clydeside'
the notion that Scotland was a more intensely patriarchal society than the rest of Britain
the idea that Scotland was an anti-immigrant, racist and religiously intolerant society


History and Philosophy of Education
This module will support students in developing their knowledge and understanding of the roots of some key educational ideas in history. These will be considered from a philosophical perspective.

The Scramble for the Middle East: Arab Nationalism, Zionism and European Colonial Powers, 1914-1939 
The interwar years are central to any analysis of the decline of European colonial rule in the Middle East and the formation of nation states. It was in the 1920s and 1930s that British and French mandatory authorities faced the emergence of nationalist movements throughout the Arab world as well as the increasing competition and penetration of hostile forces.
Students will examine historical themes and events that are significant to the development of political and cultural identities in the Middle East. Through the analysis of primary sources, students will focus on:

the debate surrounding British and French colonial practices
the emergence of the Zionist movement and the creation of a Jewish home in Palestine
the radicalisation of Arab nationalism and its impact upon the relations between local political elites and European colonial powers
the increasing tension between Jewish and Arab communities in Palestine
the creation of the mandates in Palestine, Transjordan, Syria and Lebanon and the process that led to the independence of Egypt and Iraq
the challenge brought by German and Italian subversive activities to British and French strategic interests in the region


Twentieth-Century Czechoslovakia
The class will explore major themes in twentieth-century European history:

the post-World War I settlement
the rise of fascism
the origins and course of the Second World War, Soviet expansion, the Cold War, the social and political revolutions of the 1960s and the waning of the Soviet Union in the 1980s and 1990s -- from the perspective of a central European country which was created in 1918, dissolved in 1993, and whose opinions were seldom taken into account by the Great Powers.

Students will obtain a solid grounding in the history of Czechoslovakia from its creation to its dissolution. The class should also offer a useful introduction to themes in twentieth-century European history more generally.
Independent reading will concentrate heavily on source material, enabling students to taste the excitement as well as the frustrations of historical research. By being encouraged to view European affairs from a Czech perspective while at the same time having special responsibility for one other European country, students will be led to consider the problems of historical bias and subjectivity, and should develop historical empathy as well as considerable sensitivity to the complexity of international affairs.

Rwanda: Peace, Conflict & the Politics
The purpose of this special subject is to introduce students to the study of peace and conflict, broadly defined, and to encourage them to write and think about these subjects in a critical and engaged manner informed first and foremost by history-based discourse, but also borrowing from political science, anthropology, and related disciplines.
The module will focus on the case study of Rwanda, with individual classes proceeding chronologically.
The first semester will cover the pre-colonial period to the start of the second Hutu Republic in 1973, while the second semester will cover 1973 to present.
Throughout, students will analyse relevant primary and secondary sources to explore the benefits of applying a historical lens to understanding a nation whose recent history includes both periods of peace and political stability, and several manifestations of state-sanctioned violence, including colonialism, small-scale ethnic, regional, and political conflicts, civil war, genocide, and authoritarianism.
Students seeking careers in human rights advocacy, international law, diplomacy, and journalism will also find this course particularly relevant.

Plantation in Ulster
This class will explore the plantations that took place in Ulster during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.
Students will examine the emergence of the idea for plantation in Ireland, why Ulster was regarded as suitable for plantation, and the various endeavours by English and Scots to settle in the north of Ireland, whether by private enterprise or by the state. This will culminate in the official Plantation of Ulster, a 'British' project initiated by James VI and I in the early years of his reign as king of England, Ireland and Scotland.
Students will also look at a couple of cases studies of individuals who were involved in plantation, enabling a detailed study of the political, social, economic and confessional reasons why they chose to migrate to and settle in Ireland at this time.

France at War, 1870-1962
The class begins with the traumatic episodes of the Franco-Prussian War and the Communes of 1871. By analysing the often problematic political and cultural consolidation of the Third Republic, this class will explore the ‘culture wars’ and the internal divisions that culminated in the Dreyfus Affair. After the humiliation of losing its status as Europe’s dominant power, France sought greatness in colonial expansion in Africa and Indochina, while seeking to consolidate national identity by transforming ‘peasants into Frenchmen’.
You'll explore the experiences of the First World War, assessing the strength of French unity in the face of the German enemy. The interwar clashes between fascism and the Popular Front will then be examined and how the First World War impacted upon French foreign policy and attitudes towards future war.
You'll spend three weeks exploring the enduring controversies of the Second World War, focusing upon the collapse, resistance, collaboration, and French involvement in the persecution of the Jews, as France faced its ‘hereditary enemy’ once again.
The class concludes with an analysis of the French withdrawal from Indochina and Algeria and an assessment of France’s position in the post-war global order.
A variety of sources will be explored throughout the class, including paintings, monuments, films, literary sources, newspaper reports, memoirs and archival documents.

provide students with a basic knowledge of the history, structure and institutions of the Scottish legal system
provide students with the skills required to find, interpret and analyse the law applicable in Scotland, from all their various sources
introduce students to competing conceptions of law
introduce students to legal reasoning


Public Law 1
Following on from the introduction to the constitution – its key actors, institutions and their functions – in Public Law 1, students taking Public Law 2 will build upon that knowledge here: first by focusing on the ways in which legal (judicial review) and quasi-legal (tribunals, public inquiries, ombudsmen) bodies supervise the exercise of constitutional and administrative decision making; secondly, by a detailed analysis of the political and legal mechanisms which exist for the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. As such, Public Law 2 is concerned with the abuse of power, and the ways and means by which power can be limited and held to account – whether that is the power of a golf club to suspend an unruly member, the power of a local authority to order the compulsory purchase of privately owned property, or the power of the Prime Minister to wage war.

unmarried domestic relations, opposite-sex and same-sex


Commercial Law
Commercial law is a second year compulsory subject on the LLB (and LML) degree. The class provides students with an understanding of commercial law in a Scottish context. It partially meets the commercial law subject requirements and related skills outcomes of the Law Society of Scotland and the Faculty of Advocates (albeit that some of the commercial professional topics, eg sale of goods and insurance law, are dealt with by other courses).
Building on the knowledge acquired by students in first year, the general academic objective of the course is to examine the basic principles and rules concerning core aspects of commercial law, including the main principles of agency, partnership and company law, the law relating to various methods of payment (including consumer credit and bills of exchange) the rules governing the ways in which creditors can ‘secure’ repayment of a debt (eg through taking personal guarantees from third parties for repayment of the debt, or by establishing rights in security over debtor property); the basic principles of diligence; the consequences of both corporate and individual debtor inability to repay debts (corporate insolvency and personal bankruptcy respectively).
While the focus of the class is on ‘a black letter’ analysis of relevant statutory and common law in the broad commercial area, in order to aid understanding of relevant principles, the class also examines the policy rationales underlying the current law and recent and projected reforms in this area.

Involuntary Obligations: Delict & Unjustified Enrichment
The design of this class is primarily aimed at enhancing students’ ability to read cases, deal with case law and apply the techniques of case-analysis and common law development.
The student will acquire an in-depth and up to date knowledge and understanding, from both a legal and a social perspective, of the rules of law governing involuntary obligations, that is to say the law of delict and the law of unjustified enrichment.
Students will acquire the ability to apply the rules of law to particular fact situations in order to provide definitive answers to the problems exposed in these situations.
Students will develop critical and reasoning skills, giving them the ability to make and present personal and informed judgments on the rules of law and their application within the domestic legal system.

Property Trusts & Succession

Housing Law
The aim of the class is to introduce the student to the law of landlord and tenant, and to concepts of housing need and market allocation of housing resources and the different ways in which such concepts are interpreted and operated in modern Britain.  The method of teaching and assessing the class is designed to enhance learning, academic and transferable skills.

International Private Law
This class aims to provide students with an understanding of the problems inherent in situations involving a foreign element and the basic concepts and principles of Scots international private law. More particularly, attention will be given to the rules which establish when the Scottish court has jurisdiction in any case involving a foreign element. The class will also determine the applicable law in cases involving international elements heard before a Scottish court and the rules on recognition and enforcement of judgments in certain contexts.
The International private law rules in relation to:

contract
delict
marriage
divorce & nullity
parent & child
property
insolvency & succession

Tutorials for this class take place on Saturday mornings.

Competition Law
Most industrialised countries, and the European Union now have elaborate laws, rules and procedures for ensuring the maintenance of a competitive economy. This course looks at how the competition laws of the United Kingdom and the European Union affect how business operates in Britain.
If you're contemplating a career in business, or are simply a consumer, some knowledge of competition is useful. If you're a student of industrial economics, or of marketing, some knowledge of competition law is a wise precaution. Moreover there are considerably more job opportunities in this area, whether as an economic adviser, legal practitioner or in-house lawyer advising on effective compliance.

Discrimination Law
Although we are all equal in the law, some are treated more equally than others. This module examines the nature of discrimination and some of the reasons for it, and the history of the law which tries to prohibit it and promote equality. The class looks in depth at the Equality Act 2010 and relevant case law. It covers the protected characteristics, direct and indirect discrimination, harassment, victimisation and disability discrimination, including the duty to make reasonable adjustments. As well as individual anti-discrimination law in employment and goods and services, the class examines preventive and pro-active measures, including positive action and the public equality duty and the arguments around their nature.
Assessment consists of a group presentation on an approved topic of your choice and a piece of coursework requiring problem solving skills and analysis of law and policy.

Ethics & Justice
The Ethics and Justice class aims to introduce students to the world of work by bridging the gap between theory and practice, and by providing them with the intellectual and practical tools to deal with the personal and practical dimensions of law in a competent, ethical and socially responsible manner.
The class will help to develop students’ legal, intellectual and practical skills, and provide them with an opportunity to reflect on the effectiveness and ethics of what they do and how this fits in with problems of access to justice. It will also enhance student understanding of the social and economic context in which legal rules operate.
This class is only open to Law Clinic students with case experience.

Crime & Punishment
This class encourages students to think constructively and critically about contemporary issues in the field of criminology. It also focuses on contemporary responses to crime in the fields of punishment, imprisonment and penal policy, with reference to developments in Scotland and beyond.

The class focuses on a selection of the most prominent human rights which have resulted in considerable amounts of litigation.  You'll consider the right to life, right not to be tortured, freedom of expression, children’s rights and issues regarding terrorism.

Employment Law
This class aims to provide students with an understanding of employment law in a UK and EU-wide context and to introduce students to the sources, principles and main features of employment law.
You'll learn about key employment protection provisions and the major collective provisions of employment law in the UK, including the legal position of the contract of employment, the status of employee, the law and practice of unfair dismissal, discrimination law and working time regulations.
The class will focus on practical employment law involving practitioners, an Employment Judge and an Employment Tribunal visit.

Banking Law & Finance 
This course is concerned with the legal relationship of banker and customer and the services offered by bankers in the community. It examines the financial instruments employed in financing trading and other transactions and is especially concerned with the law and practice of lending, both secured and unsecured.

Intellectual Property Law
Intellectual property is integral to all our daily lives, whether it is the music we listen to, the news we read, or chair we sit on, as well as providing the resources necessary to produce new medicines, and the superabundance of brand marketing to which we are routinely subjected.
The class will study the law of patents, trademarks (registered and unregistered), copyright, and moral rights, and the law of confidence (which includes trade secrets). Both the substantive law, and the underlying policy behind providing exclusive rights for this type of property will be examined.

Public International Law 
Interested in what is going on in Syria? Concerned about what may or may not be going on in North Korea? Pondering why troops are still in Afghanistan? Then public international law might be the class for you.
The class explores the relationships between states as among themselves and with international institutions. As well as giving an overall view of the area, we'll also look at specific incidents which have arisen and which have been dominated by international law, and which in turn have made huge contributions to the area.
The syllabus looks at sources including treaties and customary law, statehood, the collective use of force, state responsibility and terrorism, the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice.

Local Government Law 
This class is evening teaching only.
In Scotland, local government employs around 250,000 people. Every council has its own legal department and nearly 10% of practising solicitors in Scotland are employed by local authorities. It is essential that lawyers in private practice have knowledge of how local government works.
The course will cover a selection of the following topics:

what local government is and what does it does
the constitutional position of local government
the structure of Scottish local government and its statutory framework
elections to and membership of a local authority
rights, duties, liabilities and restrictions of councillors
the councillors’ Code of Conduct and registration of interests
the powers of local government; the ultra vires rule; community planning; the power of wellbeing; publicity powers
byelaws, management rules and private Acts of Parliament
how councils work; the political dimension
external controls on local government; the courts; the ombudsman, the Standards Commission, the Accounts Commission
a brief guide to local government finance


Politics 1A: Concepts & Processes
This class provides an introduction to the study of politics from a scientific perspective. The course covers how modern states around the world function and interact through from a social science perspective. The course will cover the basic concepts that characterise the essence of political life within and across countries and use these concepts to explore arguments and theories on the functioning of human behaviour. We'll cover key concepts, ranging from the meaning of democracy and authoritarianism, to structures and institutions – including elections and governments – essential to understanding modern politics.
You'll leave the class with the basic tools, concepts and approaches to interpret the political events as a political scientist and the background information to succeed in your journey through political science topics at the University of Strathclyde.

Politics 1B: Decision making & Outcomes
This class investigates the role of actors and political institutions in policymaking processes within states and across political regimes. The class builds on Politics 1A in which the main focus was on concepts and key institutions. This previous knowledge is used to develop a deeper understanding of political actors’ behaviour and the processes through which they influence outcomes. It covers a range of political processes that take place within democratic and non-democratic states and beyond. The class examines a range of outcomes that influence the lives of citizens, including the policies associated with modern welfare states.
You'll leave the class with the ability to read and critically discuss research in political science and the broader social sciences. This class will equip you to evaluate academic findings and debates in the field of comparative politics, to interpret the political events as a political scientist and to build foundational knowledge for undertaking research in political science topics.

International Relations & Global Politics
The objective of this class is to introduce you to the academic study of International Relations (IR). The class begins by examining the basic concepts and historical contexts in order to give you a firm grounding in IR. The next part of the course delves into the major theories of IR, which will provide you with conceptual underpinnings into world affairs. The course then examines the structures and processes within IR, covering topics such as the changing nature of war, international security and international institutions.

Political Philosophy
This class covers the key normative concepts used in political philosophy. This includes justice, equality, democracy, the state, collective action and rights.
You'll study different approaches to these concepts, analysing political practices and applying the concepts to political institutions. The class will reference your knowledge of empirical political science (political institutions, political behaviour), learnt in other politics classes. You'll also consider the application of political philosophy to practical policy making problems.

Research Design for Political Science
Social science students are expected to develop core research skills, learn to work in groups, planning and conducting independent research projects. This course ensures that you understand the ideas of applied social research, and thus it prepares you for an employment market that seeks out graduates with research skills beyond narrow subject-specific knowledge.

Quantitative Methods in Social Research
This class teaches students a range of quantitative research methods. It will help you better understand the high quantity of statistics published by governments and in the media. Additionally, learning quantitative methods improves your job prospects and equips you better for study in Honours and beyond.

Research Methods for Political Scientists
On the basis of the knowledge acquired in this course, students will be able to critically assess the validity and reliability of published research, to develop a research design, and to collect, analyse and present data.
You'll learn about different methods of:

social science research
distilling information from academic work
collecting and analysing data
the basic design of surveys conducive to quantitative analysis and conducting of qualitative interviews
• the use of SPSS as an analytical tool used by many businesses and organisation
the basics of uni-variate and bi-variate statistical analysis


European Politics
This class provides a comprehensive overview of European politics, identifying the common characteristics of politics and government across the continent, but also the distinguishing features that make countries different. The class combines thematic topics with studies of politics and government in particular countries - France, Germany, Italy, and the countries of eastern and central Europe.
The first section of class examines the emergence and evolution of parties and party systems, focusing on the relationship between parties and society, ideological developments and modernisation processes. Particular attention is given to the emergence of ‘new politics’ and the rise of the far right.  This part of the class concludes with an examination of the different types of electoral system employed in Europe, and the effects they have on politics.
The second section focuses on government; the character of government at the centre, multilevel governance, and parliaments.

American Politics
This class introduces students to the basic concepts and theories relating to the study of political institutions, processes, behaviour, and policy in the United States. The first half of the class examines ‘American exceptionalism,’ and its political culture. The second half examines the institutions of the US political system, covering such topics as the constitution, federalism and the branches of the central government. The class will conclude with a survey of public policy in the United States, in several dimensions.
Class topics include:

the US party system
political participation and mobilisation
individual voting behaviour
public opinion
nominations and elections
media
interest groups
the question of where power lies


Scottish Politics 
The class seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of Scottish politics contextualising it within UK, European and world politics, historical inheritance and contemporary Scottish society. It examines the practice of Scotland’s governing institutions, the changing nature of democracy in Scotland, the impact of devolution on policy and broader governance as well as Scotland’s constitutional status.

Chinese Politics
This class will provide a comprehensive overview of Chinese politics since 1949, contextualising it within the study of comparative politics, historical inheritance and contemporary Chinese society.
It will give you grounding in the dynamic evolution of the Chinese state and Chinese nationalism, China’s self-identified problems of weakness and underdevelopment, and the difficult political choices faced by political elites. It will also analyse how the country’s Communist legacy offers both opportunities and constraints for the present politics of China. The case of Taiwan is also included as a comparison.

Local Politics
This class looks at the issue of who holds power in local politics in the UK as well as examining changing managerial and democratic practice. It asks fundamental questions about local politics, such as:

how is local democracy justified?
who holds power?
what is the basis of that power?
what is the role of citizens in localities today?
what is the role of local governing institutions?
how are local public services delivered
how is policy made and delivered?


Parliamentary Studies
This class is co-taught with staff from the UK Parliament and the Scottish Parliament. It also involves deliberative sessions with parliamentarians.

Contemporary British Governance
The class focuses on how Britain is governed, focusing particularly on how its main institutions and processes – with their own influences, conflict and dynamics – have risen to the multiple challenges of the modern world, ranging from demands for sub-national autonomy in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to the opportunities and constraints afforded by Britain’s membership of the European Union.

War, Terrorism & Conflict
This course looks at the multi-faceted and ever-changing nature of war, conflict and terrorism, in the context of the end of the Cold War and the September 11 terrorist attacks. It addresses debates within the sub-discipline of Strategic Studies (for example, the study of the use of force) and International Relations more broadly, relevant to the causes of war, the conditions of peace and strategies for dealing with terrorism and conflict.

Philosophy of Economic Policy
Economics is not only about the technical allocation of scarce resources among competing needs. Economy policy choices inevitably involve political trade-offs, social concerns and value judgments. In this light, this class looks at the ideational and ethical underpinnings of public policymaking. The focus is on how the clash of economic ideas shapes policy decisions in key areas. It also examines the sources and implications of big shifts in policy paradigms. An effort will be made to make sense of the direction of economics and the rethinking of policy frameworks in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.
This course familiarizes you with the historical debates over alternative economic paradigms and policies and their historical and philosophical foundations. Questions such as why some nations are richer than others and what should governments do to overcome economic crises are as pressing today as they were a century ago. Indeed, the question “what is the best economic policy” has been asked and debated over centuries, and, as it turns out, policymakers are still guided by ideas and paradigms that were articulated by men and women centuries ago. At the end of this course, the you'll have a better knowledge about how our economic and financial world was developed.

Can Democracy Deliver?
This course is part of the university’s new initiative in Vertically Integrated Projects for Sustainable Development (VIP4SD). VIPs are designed to provide students from second-year through to postgraduate with an opportunity to work with teams of other students on projects related to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. Undergraduate students may participate in a project for up to three years.
In this VIP we'll examine the linkages between the quality of democratic governance, citizenship, service delivery, and quality of life in developing countries, with a focus on Africa. You'll have the opportunity to investigate important policy-relevant questions using various forms of survey, administrative, national accounts, and spatial data to track progress toward the sustainable development goals and investigate factors that facilitate or retard sustainable development. The complexity of the research project will differ according to the level of the student.

Theories & Practices of Regulation & Governance
The aim of this class is to introduce students to the concepts, theories, institutions and processes of regulatory governance. The transnational and international dimension of regulatory governance is also taken into account.

Political Parties
This class adopts a comparative approach to the study of political parties and party systems, focusing on Europe and the United States. We discuss the main functions and organisational and ideological characteristics of the different types of parties found in these regions, and the way in which parties adapt to social change.
We look at the relationship between parties and voters from the alternative theoretical perspectives of class voting, partisan identification and rational choice. We also examine party systems and party government.

Comparative Politics
The class focuses on how we do comparative politics (methodology). We'll consider the comparative method, and how the scientific method can be applied to the study of politics. We consider the problem of only having a relatively small number of cases to compare, and how we select these, as well as the difference between case-study driven, small-n and large-n studies. We also consider the use of ideal types – the importance of finding a language to compare very complex systems.

Green Politics
This class is divided into four main blocks:

green political theory
environmental attitudes & behaviour
environmental movements
green parties


Political Behaviour
The focus of this class is the individual voter. Individual characteristics, such as education, socio-economic status, political attitudes and values, or involvement in social and political networks are looked at. However, contextual factors, such as the institutional framework, can also play a role for a wide range of political actions.

Feminism & Politics
This class provides a critical introduction to feminism and its implications for politics. Over the last few decades, feminists have systematically challenged the long-standing view that politics is gender-neutral by uncovering masculinist bias and drawing attention to the neglected experiences, values and arguments of women.
Feminists have also reconstructed key political concepts and practices and expanded the range of issues and ideas understood to be political.

International Relations Theory in a Global Age
This class explores debates about key concepts in International Relations theory, in the context of what is widely seen as a new era in the analysis and practice of global politics. The class investigates the 'cutting-edge' of IR theory and makes connections with social and political thought more generally.

International Security: Concepts & Issues
Students are introduced to the literature and research agendas related to security and conflict studies. Specifically, the course will explore various aspects of civil war, terrorism, international conflict, arms transfers and refugee security.

Analysing Religion & Politics
The impact of faith upon politics is evident in many ways, including:

the 1979 revolution in Iran
conflicts in Afghanistan and the Middle East
the Catholic Church's contribution to democratisation efforts in Latin America and Eastern Europe
the role of religious actors in current debates on Islam in the EU

The class introduces students to the systematic study of these phenomena based on a quantitative methods perspective. Qualitative approaches are also considered. As part of the class assessment, students will conduct an empirical case study.

Social Policy & Society in Contemporary Scotland
This class is designed to introduce you to some of the major issues confronting Scottish society and to provide an accessible introduction to some of the key concerns of Social Policy.  It will examine a range of issues, including questions of poverty and inequality, social divisions, health, housing, education, and criminal justice.

Private Issues & Public Problems
This class examines the different ways in which ‘private issues’ become recognised as ‘public problems’.  Using a number of different case studies, such as domestic violence, homelessness or poverty, it will look at the different ways in which social problems have been identified and at the different standpoints from which they can be viewed.

Scottish Social Policy since 1845
This class explores some of the different ways in which social policy has evolved in Scotland in response to a variety of social problems since the introduction of the Scottish Poor Law Act in 1845. It covers all the main areas of social policy, including health, housing, education and poverty, and also explores the changing boundaries between individuals, families, communities, voluntary organisations, commercial welfare and state over the course of this period.

Key Concepts in Social Welfare
This class explores some of the most important concepts in the academic study of Social Policy, including such concepts as equality, justice, need, happiness, poverty and wellbeing. It also examines a number of different ideological perspectives on these issues, such as liberalism, conservatism, socialism, social democracy, Marxism, feminism and the New Right.

The Making of Social Policy
This class examines the ways in which social policies are ‘made’ at both a national and international level.  It examines the roles played by different actors, institutions and ideas.  It also looks at the ways in which evidence is used to inform policy-making, and at the ways in which we are all involved, as citizens, in the policy process.  These themes are explored with the aid of a series of case-studies, including health and education policies, and the development and implementation of equalities legislation.

Research Skills in Social Policy
This class will help you to develop your knowledge and understanding of some of the key methods used by researchers in the field of social policy.  It will introduce you to a number of different qualitative and quantitative methods, and to some of the basic principles of research design.  It will provide an essential foundation for your final-year dissertation.﻿

Scottish Social Welfare in a UK Context
This class examines the ways in which recent political developments have placed questions of social policy at the heart of debates over the future of the United Kingdom.  To what extent do the different parts of the UK face different social problems?  To what extent do different parts of the UK possess a different approach to the resolution of these issues?  How has the governance of social policy in different parts of the UK been affected by its current constitutional arrangements?

The Welfare State in Comparative Perspective
This class examines the development of welfare states as a global phenomenon.  It asks what we mean by the concept of a ‘welfare state’ and looks at the ways in which welfare states have developed in different countries.  It also explores some of the major differences between different types of welfare state, using the concept of ‘welfare régimes’.

Workplace Learning & Practice 1
This module seeks to build upon students' practical knowledge and understanding gained at HNC level in a particular discipline and to extend their understanding of how practice is driven by the need to develop the concept of working collaboratively.  Auditing a range of services/settings will develop an insight and awareness of the complexities of professional practice in collaborative settings. Students will be introduced to the concept of analysing and evaluating material gathered from the audit.

The Societal Context of Professional Working
Students intending to work within community health, education or social services should familiarise themselves with the societal context in which they'll work. The ‘societal context’ refers to social factors that may influence the needs for services, and may also impact on their effective delivery. This awareness envelops the individual’s social responsibilities and the responsibilities of the professional groups involved in service provision.
Students will explore the nature of the 'community,' how it develops and how it is defined. Students will also look at the professional codes that facilitate social interaction, reciprocity and cooperation. Social problems and the roles of professionals are also explored.
This module shall lay the basis for issues that shall be developed further in Level 9: Context, Policy and Joint Working.

How People Develop & Learn
Professionals working with people need to understand the dynamics of human development and learning and the contexts that influence this. In order to enhance the quality of life for people who use Education and Social Services, professionals need to understand how people develop and learn. The aim of the module is to build on earlier study and enhance students' understanding of how learning and development is influenced by social, environmental, biological, cultural and personal factors.
Students in higher education need to understand the processes of learning and development in order to enhance their skills and maximise their own capacity for lifelong learning.

Introduction to Integrated Services
The integration of services through joint planning and delivery of services across health, education, community education, social work and related services has been identified as a key mechanism for supporting families, facilitating learning, protecting children, promoting health and wellbeing and empowering communities socially and economically. There is growing recognition that practitioners need to be competent in working with others in disciplines other than their own. This is, in part, recognition of a history of service failure arising from ineffective collaboration across disciplines.
Developing professionals in educational and social services are required to understand the knowledge, skills and values required to work collaboratively and the challenges to services themselves as they respond to the integrated services agenda.

Being Professional Working Collaboratively
This model provides a structured and supported introduction to quality frameworks and to how quality is evaluated. It is put into context by looking at students' placement experiences as well as exploring national contexts through consideration of policy, literature and e-learning sources.
The module also helps the development of a critical, evidence-based and reflective approach to professional development and professional action.

Contexts Policy & Joint Working 
Particular emphasis is placed on students' ability to appreciate the theory of effective inter-agency and collaborative practice, including issues of individual and community empowerment, accountability and leadership.
Students will learn about the relationship of theory of community, family and human development to the development of social policy, with particular emphasis on effective inter-agency and collaborative practice and its implementation within students' practice placement.

Management & Leadership in Integrated Services
This module aims to develop students' knowledge and understanding of issues affecting the leadership and management of self and others, the change process, management of conflict and a consideration of the skills required to successfully lead and manage in a social services establishment. This module is aimed at all professionals whether or not they hold posts of responsibility.
The module is mapped to the SSSC NOS for health and social service workers, the NHS Leadership Framework and the Standard for Childhood Practice.

Understanding How People Behave
Students builds on and use the learning they have gained from the first module of this strand, How People Develop and Learn. A central theme throughout the module is developing understanding and awareness of the operation of discrimination and disadvantage at personal, cultural and structural levels.
Students will also develop their understanding of observation, assessment, recording, analysis and approaches to the management of behaviour as well as ways to support service users.

Workplace Learning & Practice 2
Students further develop the professional knowledge, values and skills relevant for integrated practice and for managing a specific development project.
The placement will consolidate the student’s learning from across the course, particularly building on the key theories that have been introduced in the Management and Leadership in Integrated Services module. The module will have two phases: a project planning phase and a project implementation phase.
In order to further develop professional competences students will also continue to engage in the range of activities undertaken in Workplace Learning and Practice 1.

Workplace Learning & Practice 3
This class provides an extended work-based learning experience, which will enable students to apply knowledge and theory to integrated services. It'll offer opportunities for students to consider how integrated services meet the needs of service users, and understand the role of evidence informed practice in the delivery of services.

Specialist Pathway
This class aims to provide students with an in-depth knowledge of contemporary practice issues in relation to specific service user groups. The class develops knowledge and skills in meeting the needs of people in a range of targeted services across the lifespan.

Personal & Professional Development
The aim of the class is to provide a formal and structured opportunity for consolidation of learning and planning for future learning and employment. Students will formally record and capture their learning and use this knowledge to gain relevant employment following graduation.

Professional Inquiry & Evidence Informed Practice - Dissertation
Students undertake a small-scale project for their honours dissertation in social work. It directly addresses the growing recognition that practitioners in Education and Social Care must be competent in reviewing using and conducting research.

Education of Looked After Children
This module contributes to an understanding of the lived experiences of children who are in alternative care arrangements and critically explores the challenges to integrated and partnership working in meeting the educational needs of looked after children.

Spanish Honours Language 4
There are three strands in the Spanish 4 Language programme, which are closely integrated with each other: Language A (writing in Spanish), Language B (analysis and translation into English of Spanish texts), and Language C (oral presentation and interpreting). The programme will enable students to function in the target language at a sufficiently high level of ability, both spoken and written, to be accepted as a fully competent member of the target language community, and effectively to discharge a professional role within and/or in relation to that community.

Hispanic Studies 4
This is a level four Honours class designed to build on the knowledge of Hispanic cultural studies acquired in Spanish and Latin American Studies 1A, II and III. The purpose of this class is to explore contemporary issues in Hispanic cultures. Class content will reflect the research specialisms of staff in Spanish and the actual texts and films studies may vary from year to year to reflect student demand and staff availability, as determined by the research focus of the subject. Each year, the class will focus on specific aspects of Hispanic history, politics, society and/or cultures.

Shaping Spain: Ideas, Beliefs & Identity 
Rooted in the Spanish History of Ideas, this course explores the condition and motivations for the development of some of the existing main currents of thought in Spain since 1989. It encourages a critical understanding of Spanish history and contextualises the work of several Spanish seminal thinkers (Unamuno, Ortega, Azaña and Zambrano) and it explores their thought in relation to the key themes of the course: ideas, beliefs, and identity.

Education & Learning
The overall purpose of this class is to develop student’s understanding of educational thought and language. Because this class is not organised around a given profession (e.g. teaching in schools) the discussion of education will be quite general and applies to any educational context, from parenting, to school, to college, to lifelong learning and informal education. ‘Education and Learning’ addresses questions that are at the heart of understanding what education is and what learning is. That these terms denote different things is an important starting point.

TESOL 1: An Introduction
This module introduces students to the fundamentals of language learning. Students will develop a basic understanding of current views on how languages are learned. Drawing on their own experience as language learner/users, this module will examine key theories and concepts in second language acquisition.

Digital Technologies in Language Education
This module explores the use of digital technologies for language teaching and learning. The aim is to give students an overview of the tools and activities used in the field of computer-assisted language learning (CALL). Students will also develop the practical experience of using digital technology, learn to design and evaluate digital materials for the language classroom, and create the digital environment for language learning. The module considers ways to develop students’ 21st Century skills both as language user/learners and as language teachers.

Culture, Society, Formation
The purpose of Culture, Society, Formation is to introduce students to a sample of foundational texts which have informed and transformed our understanding of culture and society and to consider the impact that these understandings have had and continue to have on education. Through a critical reading of excerpts from such historical and contemporary texts as The Prince, The Communist Manifesto, and Gender Trouble, the module will take what is foundational in cultural and sociological writing and explore it in the context of educational conditions.

Developing Language and Communication Skills
This module will equip students with the required knowledge of understanding the process of reading, writing, listening and speaking in a second/foreign language, especially in academic settings. The aim is to give students increased confidence in communicating in English. Students will extend their vocabulary, improve their pronunciation and grammatical accuracy, and develop their communicative competence.

Adult Education with Placement
The purpose of this module is twofold. First, it aims to offer an overview of key considerations (e.g. literacy, multilingualism, new technologies) in the development of educational activities for adult learners through a series of pre-placement seminars. Second, the students will have the opportunity to apply the new knowledge and skills learned during a one-week placement with an organisation that works with adult learners.

Children and Childhood
This class will explore how children and childhood have been imagined and constructed in a range of historical and contemporary contexts. Drawing on representations of children we aim to support you in developing an understanding of children and childhood as part of a set of social and cultural relations. With a focus on environments other than formal education, the module will seek to open for discussion the nature of childhood according to themes such as politics, history, play, work, the global and queerness.

TESOL 2: Methods, Approaches and Techniques in Language Teaching
This module introduces students to the pedagogical processes in language teaching. The topics include traditional and contemporary language teaching methods (audiolingual, communicative language teaching, task-based language learning, etc.). We will also discuss practical issues such as lesson planning, material evaluation and design, needs analysis and profiling, and classroom management. In this module, students will gain some first-hand experience of English language teaching in practice through micro-teaching.

Designing Educational Research 
This team-taught module will introduce students to the theory and practice of educational research. This includes lectures on the principles of research design and seminars in which students will collaborate in small group projects, familiarising themselves with qualitative and quantitative methods and their uses for interdisciplinary education studies research. The module will be assessed through a short essay and a research proposal, in preparation for dissertation planning.

Language Awareness: Knowledge about Language
This module aims to provide students with an introduction to ways in which the English language can be described and analysed in order to help learners to develop their knowledge about language. The module deepens students’ understanding of core features of the English language and prepares them to apply their knowledge about language systems (pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar and discourse) in teaching practice.

Critical Issues in Education
Education is not uncontested. Its place within society and the fact that nearly all have experience of education and related institutions means that a plethora of ideas and ideologies of education abound. This module discusses some of the ways in which educational moments are constructed through politics, society, culture and religion. It encourages students to delve deeply into the various forms theories and ideologies take: their formation and maintenance; and then deconstructs these. It locates education as a societal right rather than a personal endeavour so that internationally, nationally and locally agreed and contested matters take centre stage.

TESOL 3: Current Issues in Language Education
This module offers a critical examination of a range of contemporary issues in language education. Students will learn about key pedagogical issues and debates from the latest language education research. The aim is to challenge students’ existing beliefs and values in more specialised and advanced areas. Topics to be covered include individual learner differences from a sociocultural perspective, learner identity, language teaching methodologies in the changing local and global contexts, bilingualism and multilingualism, immersion and translanguaging.

Research Methods for TESOL
This module provides an introduction to research skills, research design and research methods in TESOL. It familiarises students with the research process in language education, focusing on developing students’ knowledge, skills and understanding before carrying out a small-scale research project in language education.

Educational Representations in Film and Literature
Educational Representations in Film and Literature provides students with opportunities to reflect on educational questions through popular literary and visual media. The opportunity to interpret and reflect upon education in the context of popular culture allows students to examine theories in practice, albeit fictional contexts of practice. As well as the representations of education, the literature regularly embodies the pedagogical intentions of the author, intentions which will be explored in the module. These and other considerations form the structure and content of this module.

Placement Learning: Secondary School 
Students will undertake a placement in a secondary school working with children learning English as a foreign language. This module will focus on professional identity, teacher agency and will give students the opportunity to reflect on the translation and transformation of their learning as they return to teach in their home country.

Engineering Mechanics 1 
        A study of mechanics gives you the basic tools to understand how the world, both natural and man-made.
You come to Engineering Mechanics with an elementary understanding of the basic principles of mechanics acquired from introductory school physics together with their application to problem solving. This class places more emphasis on the basic skills required to start to apply these concepts and principles to real engineering problem solving. The class focuses on the practice of these skills, rather than factual content. In this class doing required background reading, coming to class and doing homework are like practising for a football team. The tutor/lecturer is less a source of information and more of a coach who structures practice and sets standards. Students’ progress not by absorbing (and regurgitating) information but rather by practising their skills individually and learning to work effectively with others.

You should take this class if you want to engage imaginatively with both Communist and Catholic perspectives of the post-war period, read independently from a wide variety of primary sources and participate fully in seminar discussion and debate.
    
Communism in Practice: the Case of Czechoslovakia
Czechoslovakia, the last post-war European country to fall behind the Iron Curtain, was exceptional in allying itself to the Soviet Union voluntarily and in bringing its own Communists to power more or less democratically. Confident at first that it would be able to pursue its own path to socialism, the Czechoslovak Communist Party soon became one of the most rigidly Stalinist of all the Soviet satellites. The same Party which, in the 1950s, held some of the most notorious show-trials and put up the largest statue of Stalin to be found anywhere in the world, became, in the 1960s, the author of 'Socialism with a Human Face', a package of attempted economic and political reforms explosive enough to end in the country’s invasion by most of its Warsaw Pact allies.
This class will seek to move beyond the stereotypes and oversimplifications of Communism passed down by Cold War rhetoric to explore the shifting nature of Communist thought, power politics and international relations in this most perplexing of times in the history of Central Europe.

Scottish Society Since 1914
The class provides a broad survey of Scottish social history since 1914. The aim of this class is to explore the nature and development of Scottish society in the twentieth century by assessing the impact of industrialisation and the problems associated with de-industrialisation, as well as the development of an urban society.
By the end, the successful student should have expanded their knowledge of contemporary Scottish history and have a good idea of the diversity of issues, techniques and arguments which historians have deployed in the study of twentieth-century Scotland. Among the themes to be covered are:

the extent to which Scotland had a recognisable culture and identity
the myths and realities of 'Red Clydeside'
the notion that Scotland was a more intensely patriarchal society than the rest of Britain
the idea that Scotland was an anti-immigrant, racist and religiously intolerant society


The Scramble for the Middle East: Arab Nationalism, Zionism & European Colonial Powers, 1914-1939 
The interwar years are central to any analysis of the decline of European colonial rule in the Middle East and the formation of nation states. It was in the 1920s and 1930s that British and French mandatory authorities faced the emergence of nationalist movements throughout the Arab world as well as the increasing competition and penetration of hostile forces.
Students will examine historical themes and events that are significant to the development of political and cultural identities in the Middle East. Through the analysis of primary sources, students will focus on:

the debate surrounding British and French colonial practices
the emergence of the Zionist movement and the creation of a Jewish home in Palestine
the radicalisation of Arab nationalism and its impact upon the relations between local political elites and European colonial powers
the increasing tension between Jewish and Arab communities in Palestine

legal reasoning
law & politics
law & social change

 

Voluntary Obligations: Contract & Promises
While the most obvious aim of this course is to familiarise students with Scottish contract law and voluntary obligations, this aim may be divided into a number of sub-aims. They are as follows:

to place voluntary obligations within the general framework of Scots Law
to place the Scots law of voluntary obligations within its European context
to analyse and explain how contracts and promises are formed
to analyse and explain how voluntary obligations may be vitiated and on what grounds their validity may be challenged

Cultural focus: a look at current issues in the French education system.
Linguistic focus: reported speech, imperative mood, a further look at pronouns.

Scotland: Renaissance & Reformation
This course will focus on the period from the final establishment of the territorial boundaries of the Scottish kingdom in James III’s reign through to the Union of Crowns in 1603. In covering the era of the Renaissance and Reformation in Scotland, as well as the regnal union of 1603, it will focus on the reigns of successive Stewart monarchs and their subsequent accession to the English and Irish thrones, thereby creating a British imperial monarchy.
Scotland’s contact with Europe and its strained relations with England form core themes but political history will be studied in the light of the social, religious, economic and cultural developments that lend early-modern Scotland its distinct identity, thereby examining issues such as trade and economic development, the impact of the Renaissance in Scotland, literacy and the spread of reforming ideas, the arts, education and issues of identity.

Oral History: Theory & Practice
Please note that this is compulsory for students who wish to use oral history in their dissertation.
Oral history is a way of engaging with the past via the experiences and memories of those who were there. ‘Oral history’ is a multifaceted term that refers to the sources (interviews), the methodology (interviewing), theory (analysis), and products (of which there are many).
This new class aims to alert students to the possibilities of using oral history as a way of understanding the past. It will examine key concepts and methodologies in oral history and explore how oral history has helped to shape historical understanding.
This class also has an important practice-based focus – students taking the class will gain an opportunity to develop practical skills in oral history interviewing and analysis as well as to reflect critically on theory in relation to practice. They will also get an opportunity to explore the application and use of history in the public arena through engaging with work on oral history and public history.
Because of the practical nature of this class and the limited supply of equipment, numbers are capped at 25.

Propaganda & War in the 20th Century
This class examines means by which states conduct informal activities to promote their domestic and foreign objectives during wartime. In particular, it analyses the role of propaganda throughout the twentieth century, focusing on the use of modern mass communication and technology by states involved in conflicts.
The class is structured around a number of historical themes, which help shed light on the emergence of propaganda as an important means of modern warfare. Key themes analysed throughout the course include:

the First World War as the first ‘total war’
the growth of international radio broadcasting
the creation of centralised propaganda machines in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union
home-front propaganda during the Second World War
propaganda, disinformation and the Cold War
the United States and the experience of Vietnam
information, media coverage and the Gulf War
9/11 and the war on terrorism

During seminars, students will be exposed to relevant primary source material. Particular attention will be given to understanding the theory and practice of propaganda and analysing how technological developments have contributed to shaping modern information and mass persuasion.

Society & Politics in Colonial India: 1880s-1947
This class will cover the political developments and social groups from the late-nineteenth century till the decolonisation of South Asia in 1947.
This is a key period in the social and political history of modern South Asia as it witnessed the growth of a mass-based anti-colonial struggle.  Simultaneously, the involvement of different social groups in this process led to the emergence of community and caste based identity politics.  Under pressure from demands for independence, the colonial state initiated a process of phased devolution of power, and decolonisation after the Second World War.  The class will compare these developments to raise questions about the 'modernity' of colonial society and polity.  The class will analyse how different social groups - such as the peasantry, the working class and tribal groups - participated in and shaped political movements in South Asia.
Students will also be encouraged to use the regional perspective of South Asian history to understand the different expressions of class, gender and ethnicity in non-Western societies.

Literature, Language and the International Heritage Industry
English Studies, as traditionally practiced at Strathclyde, is the study of the symbolic forms of a culture, the ideas, and representations which a culture finds 'good to think'. 
This class explores how 'heritage' is constructed by the cultural industries; we look at the construction of identities, including national identities, and how those identities are deployed in a society. 
Our particular focus is on how this is achieved through literature, both producing and reabsorbing heritage identities. 
Students will learn how to read literary texts in terms of their cultural significance and will study how those cultural significances are transformed into different media, how they form the basis of people's cultural and national identity, and how they are marketed.

Intermediate Microeconomics
This is the core microeconomics class in second year. It aims to develop students’ understanding of: the concepts of consumer choice; the motives of the firm and profit maximisation; the market and its role in achieving equilibrium prices and quantities; and the implications of market power. It will introduce to students to mathematical techniques commonplace in economics, giving them the ability to apply these in a wider economic context.

Intermediate Macroeconomics & Data Analysis
The class builds upon the macroeconomic foundations established in the first year Economics class and both extends and deepens analysis. In particular this class will develop students’ ability to use key models used to analyse the determination of output in the short-run and in the medium-run. We will also cover some topics in the analysis of economic data including correlation and simple regression.

Topics in Microeconomics with Cross Section Econometrics
This class builds on the conceptual framework of Microeconomics 2 by introducing students to market imperfections through the lens of game theory. Game theory is an analytical toolbox that allows us to understand decision making in strategic environments and the class will provide students with a foundation in game theoretic reasoning.
Thereafter, this class will study how market imperfections create a role for Government in markets. In doing so, we will investigate topics including taxation, education, and crime and punishment. This class will also look to explore some of these ideas empirically using cross section data. These empirical methods will open up a new route for students to understand the key taught economic ideas in a real world context.

Topics in Macroeconomics with Time Series Econometrics
The overarching aims of this class are: to extend students' knowledge and understanding of core macroeconomic models and of the econometric methods used to analyse macroeconomic data; and to develop their ability to apply these models and methods to address some key questions in macroeconomics. The class covers: economic growth; expectations, demand and policy; Europe: past, present, and future; and policy rules versus discretion. In addition, econometric methods covered include: regression; unit root testing; modelling volatility; cointegration and error correction.

Economics project

Applied Economics
In the third year econometrics class the student will have learned about regression in both a cross-sectional data and time series data context. This class extends that knowledge in three ways.
First, for cross-sectional data, the class deals with regression techniques where the dependent variable may be restricted or limited in some way. In such cases, the regression model as taught in the third year class is not appropriate; EC413 develops models which are similar in spirit to the standard regression model, but can handle all of these cases.
A second purpose of Applied Econometrics is to develop regression methods which can be used when you have panel data - consisting of both cross-sectional and time-series dimensions.
Third, the class will build on the introduction to the econometrics of time series data developed in a previous class by developing two classes of models. One class consists of models that can accommodate multiple long run equilibrium relationships among a set of possibly non-stationary variables. A second class consists of methods for modelling volatility.

Advanced Microeconomics
Risk and uncertainty are ubiquitous in everyday life and they affect the way in which economic agents make their choices. This course will start analysing how modern economic theory deals with uncertainty and the way in which individuals makes their decisions under uncertainty. Attitude towards risk, decision-making under uncertainty, the role of insurance and financial markets will be covered in the first part of the course.
The second part will present the foundation of the Economics of Information. Building on the first part of this course and on the game theoretic framework covered in Microeconomics 3, the study of Economics of Information will provide tools for the analysis of economic situations and contracting issues when either monitoring is imperfect or information is asymmetric.
This class is intended to show how economic theory can be used to analyse individual behavior when information is not complete and decisions are risky. In particular, it will be applied to economic and business problems but also social interaction issues. In addition, the relevance of incentives and information in many economic environments will be highlighted, with particular emphasis on situations in which moral hazard and adverse selection problems arise.
This course is useful in enhancing students’ understanding of other modules and will be of particular use in students’ dissertations. Moreover, students will gain key skills in strategic thinking and the analysis of information asymmetries that will be useful both in further study and employment.

Advanced Macroeconomics
This class aims to provide students with the required tools to understand current macroeconomic issues, such as: the interactions between the banking sector and monetary policy; or the policy responses to the global financial crisis. Throughout the class the analytical usefulness of the theoretical models taught is illustrated with real-world examples.

Labour Economics
This course will examine fundamental topics in Labour Economics. The primary goal is for you to learn how economists view the world of work and pay. The focus is on applications rather than theory. Topics include human capital and signaling, discrimination, the effect of technology on the wage structure, and income inequality. Along the way, you will gain insights into data analysis and empirical methods. These are highly marketable skills that tend to be entry requirements for consulting jobs, government work, and many other sectors.

In this class we introduce you to the key knowledge and key understandings that you will need to become a successful teacher of language, literacy and literature in the primary school. It will help you to understand the role of the teacher of language in three ways: 


What you need to know yourself about language, literacy and  literature to teach it effectively ( ie CURRICULUM knowledge) 
What you need to know about how children learn and develop as learners of language and how to use this knowledge to teach well ( ie PEDAGOGIC knowledge)
What you need to know about how communities and social practice, including the school and the home, support learning ( ie ECOLOGICAL knowledge)


The class is taught by means of lectures and tutorials. You will be expected to attend all of these, to read in order to extend your thinking and to take part in study groups.
You will be asked to complete a number of tasks in school to help consolidate your understanding of the complexities of teaching language, literature and literacy.

By providing the data, and a broadly defined research agenda, the research project allow considerably more time to be spent on the analysis of the data and interpretation of results than is feasible in the context of a more conventional dissertation. While the challenge of identifying a research topic and the development of an appropriate data set are to a large extent eliminated it does allow the analytical work to be developed in more depth. The introductory class will review briefly the analysis and techniques that will be relevant for the research work to be undertaken.

Financial Analysis of a Company
This project requires that you undertake a financial analysis of a company from the standpoint of a potential investor and provide an evaluation of the investment potential of the company’s shares. An assessment should be undertaken of the company’s financial position and performance on the basis of both its financial statements and stock market performance. The discussion should also bring out clearly the financial policies of the company and how these impact on the company’s performance. 
This will require an evaluation of its capital expenditure programme, the form of financing adopted by the company, including an evaluation of its capital structure and its sources of equity and debt funding. You should differentiate between the use of internal sources of funding, in the form of retentions, and the new issues of equity, and also discuss the company’s dividend policy to the extent that this is not covered by the discussion of its retention policy. In some companies it may be difficult to identify a consistent policy perspective on some of these issues – this can be documented and its implications assessed. The project should also provide an assessment of the company’s recent stock market performance to put the current share price into context. 
The returns achieved on the company’s shares should be evaluated using an appropriate benchmark as well as the standard market ratios – the earnings yield, dividend yield, etc. The final objective of the project is an assessment of the value of the company and the investment value of its shares. Even the most experienced and capable security analysts find this a very difficult task, even though they may be monitoring a company’s performance and prospects on a continuing basis. You are simply expected to build on the financial information and analysis you have undertaken to produce some tentative assessments of value. As the focus is on the use of financial information you are expected, firstly, to undertake a “fundamental analysis” of the company. Secondly, you are expected to use the various valuation models to provide insights into the determination of the company’s market value.

It begins with a review of key theories and tools that you'll have studied as part of your degree, with consideration given on how to use these in this exercise. This is followed by analysis of material provided by the client which describes the issue to be addressed and the outcome expected by the client. This then leads into a group activity which applies particular techniques for addressing aspects of the client’s issue. More detailed client input is provided at certain points in the process often through direct interface with the client. This allows you to gain a more in-depth understanding of the issue and to try out various solutions. Further analysis is carried out by the groups and the class concludes with you presenting your thinking to their client. The client presentations are then followed by a reflective session where the tutor, client and students are encouraged to explore the process of the class and develop the learning gained.

The Shape of Stories 1 (20 credits)
The Shape of Stories 1 works with the bones of good stories across genre and form, resembling a seminar in format. This class introduces students to classic and contemporary writers and writing approaches that will be useful in future work. It also includes workshop time for students to share work with their peers and benefit from editorial feedback from tutors who are also published writers. We are mindful from day one that you are working towards the Major Project of your final Semester. The first semester is the time for planning and experimentation that will later be useful when tackling that Major Project.

The Writing Life (20 credits)
The Writing Life is all about the contemporary literary landscape. It introduces students to the practicalities of a life in the creative industries – how writers make a living, and how that living is changing in the 21st Century. Through a series of talks and seminars from visiting speakers from across the writing worlds, students will have direct access to those who have been there and done it. In assignments, students will choose a target, for example, a publisher, a journal, an online magazine – then write a new piece of creative work to submit to that target, as well as an essay profiling the target they have chosen. This ensures students increase their knowledge of the publishing industry they wish to enter while also having a practical challenge, writing to a brief they have chosen themselves.

The Shape of Stories 2 is a partner to The Shape of Stories 1, the Semester 1 workshop focused on the bones of good stories across genre and form. This module takes that a step further, exploring hybrid writing across fiction, script, screenwriting, poetry and creative non-fiction, closely studying innovative contemporary works that blur the boundaries between different kinds of writing. Students will broaden their reading and experience, and will be encouraged to experiment with hybrid forms in their own creative work. From short stories containing to poetry, from ekphrastic responses to art and photographs to autobiographical, illustrated vignettes, The Shape of Stories 2 is an opportunity to explore new possibilities, in exciting ways.

The Made Project (20 credits)
The Made Project consists of two assignments. The first is a short oral piece of creative work, which requires students to write to a time-limited brief then present that work to the group as a reading. The second is a more substantial creative piece chosen and developed in discussion with a course tutor over a number of weeks. Whether students intend to produce an adaptation of a piece of underlying material; or a response to an artwork in another form; or produce a work made in collaboration with another artist; or create and produce a podcast; or prepare and perform a piece for performance; students will—independently and in consultation with their nominated tutor—produce a piece of work with practical ‘made’ element. Students will be encouraged to produce work that adds diversity to their writing portfolio.

Advanced Topics in Creative Writing (Supervisions)
Advanced Topics in Creative Writing seeks to build upon research and writing skills developed in Semester 1 while providing significant freedom for students to pursue any genre, form or approach to creative work that excites them. It enables students to work with a staff member on a mutually agreed topic within the broad field of Creative Writing, in fiction, poetry, script, non-fiction or hybrid forms.
The student will be assigned a supervisor, after discussion with the convener, for the Advanced Topics module based on areas of interest, and will meet with that supervisor at least 5 times over Semester 2. The supervisor will identify a short initial reading list within a broad topic area and will meet with the student to discuss their reading of this literature and to assist in their development of a comprehensive reading list on a more tightly defined topic or debate identified by the student.
Future meetings will be focused around key texts and questions identified by the student. The assignments consist of one major piece of creative work in any form or genre, influenced by the student’s reading list, and a shorter critical review of the initial reading list provided.

Narrative Processing across Languages, Culture and Media
Narrative processing is a field which has seen significant advances in recent years in psychology and neuroscience and narratology. These bodies of research converge on the many ways in which narratives across cultures and media can be seen to share universal features. However, there is an even older body of work, deriving ultimately from memory studies and developing through folklore and anthropology, which illustrates how narratives meaning and interpretation changes as it moves between social settings as well as media and cultures. This class invites students to engage with these three approaches, to form views on their implications for the use of narratives between cultural groups, and to consider potential practical applications for their findings.

Contemporary Scottish Cultural Studies
This class allows students to engage with materials from Scottish, cultural, historical and literary studies.

In doing so, the class will provide students with a knowledge of some of the main developments in Scottish literary and cultural studies throughout the 20th Century. Students will gain an understanding of the relationships between literature, culture and theories of nationalism, also developing an awareness of a range of major issues in contemporary Scottish culture.

Transcultural Fandom & British Popular Culture: Reading & Writing in Online Communities
This Masters option explores online fanfiction and fan communities and investigates how they work with and transform key popular texts and genres from British literary history. We will study reading and writing practices and consider questions of adaptation across cultures, in relation to texts and themes which may have a global presence across different forms of media. Fan studies is a growing area within media/cultural studies, and fanfiction studies is rapidly developing as a new field of exploration for literary scholars. We will read cutting-edge, as well as. canonical critical works in fan studies, and consider through this class how this field is developing and what new directions are emerging for research and scholarship. Students on this class are welcome to choose their own topics to explore, outwith the texts specifically covered in our classes.
This class is suitable for anyone interested in learning more about transformative works and fan cultures: no prior knowledge of fanfiction or experience with fan culture is necessary. For students with a background in English studies and Creative Writing, it features questions about literary genre and form, about online writing communities and their readers, and about the global re-interpretation of British culture and literature. For students primarily focused on 'TESOL and Intercultural Communication', it offers opportunities to consider how fan communities enable language learners and use particular kinds of intercultural communication through shared knowledge of and admiration for a 'canonical' work. For students with a background in gender studies, fanfiction and fan cultures supply an extraordinarily rich source for investigating how gender is depicted, discussed and debated by a very large cohort of predominately female-identifying or LGBTQ+ fans.

Fleshy Histories: Meat Eating & Meat Avoidance, 1500 to the Present 
This class will engage students with literary and historical materials, and with theoretical work from animal studies and ecofeminism. This will inform discussions about the place, meaning and function of meat eating and meat avoidance, and debates about human-animal relations, from the early modern to the modern world.
As well as philosophical and religious work you'll read a range of primary materials, including literary works from A String of Pearls (aka Sweeney Todd) to Roald Dahl’s Pig; from Swift’s Modest Proposal to Coetzee’s Lives of Animals, via Dracula, and develop skills in textual analysis and critical and theoretical engagement.

The Major Project (60 Credits)
The only module in Semester 3 is the triple module we call The Major Project. This is an extended piece of creative work in students’ chosen field, that they will develop with a supervisor who will get to know them and their work closely.
The process starts with students sending an outline of their planned project for discussion with staff, before a supervisor is assigned to work with students regularly over the summer. This is the time for more focussed work on the page, and closer editing.
Using the skills acquired in Semesters 1 and 2, students will now be fully independent researchers, ready to pursue their signature work which is intended to be a potential submission to an agent or publisher. Whatever form it takes, when students leave us, their work will be ready to present to the world at large. Novelists will make serious headway into their manuscript; poets and essayists and short story writers will amass the beginnings of a collection; screenwriters will have a full draft of a feature film or series pilot.

Criminal Justice & Penal Decision-Making

Punishment & Processes of Penal Change
The western world’s “penal crisis” has, over the past thirty years, posed specific challenges to the reform tradition.
In this module we explore the nature, dimensions and national permutations of that crisis, putative solutions to it and likely obstacles to their realisation. We draw on theoretical developments in the study of justice and punishment and explore their potential to illuminate and inform processes of progressive penal change.
The module examines contemporary changes, international evidence and policy transfer, and technological challenges and considers reform across the globe. The module draws on insights and perspectives including law, the sociology of punishment, history and the social sciences
Learning is conducted through a range of innovative methods such as debates and media representations. The module is supplemented by visits to key institutions' prisons, women’s justice centres, as well as conferences with key practitioners and policy makers.

Restorative Justice
Restorative justice as applied to criminal harms, has grown and spread rapidly across the world in the last twenty years or so. Research indicates that in comparison with formal or retributive justice there can be more positive outcomes for both offender and victims. Yet the adoption of restorative justice within or alongside criminal justice systems has been patchy.
Experience has shown that restorative justice is a popular topic and this module provides an opportunity for advanced learning. Your learning will be accompanied by practical exercises, such as simulations led by leading practitioners.

Childhood & Crime
Youth justice attracts interest across society, politically, socially and legally. Some issues – from the murder of two year old James Bulger in 1993 by two 10 year old children to the riots in 2011 in England – spark moral panic and demonstrate the extent to which such matters cut across disciplinary boundaries and influence legal and societal responses to children who offend.
Youth justice generates its own philosophical approaches eg in the welfare / justice debate. It also provides a context within which to examine broader issues affecting criminal justice as a whole such as the need to balance the rights of the accused against the public interest.
This class will provide an opportunity for you to critically examine some key aspects of youth justice law, policy and philosophy from a number of perspectives. Your learning will be supplemented by visits to custodial and innovative community settings, as well as a visit to and a simulation of Scotland’s unique system of ‘Children’s Hearings’ (a decision-making system based on the best needs of the child).

Surveillance, Technology & Control
Surveillance and the use of technology in criminal justice is becoming increasingly important.
This module focuses on aspects of surveillance studies that inform the study criminal justice and penal change. If it's true that surveillance is ethically and politically problematic, how can or should it be used? Contemporary forms are stimulated by technological developments that were unavailable in earlier eras, whose deployment and consequences are, as yet, only beginning to be understood. Is increased surveillance inevitable? What is its impact on privacy and patterns of social exclusion? How can it be used for benign, even progressive objectives?
The module focuses on theoretical understandings of surveillance, selected substantive aspects of it, patterns of resistance to it, and forms of regulation of it that have emerged in relation to it, including privacy and human rights concerns. Learning is supplemented by visits to the CCTV monitoring centre and Electronic Monitoring centre.

The Global Cold War in Africa
This class introduces students to major debates in the history of the Cold War in Africa, especially focusing on the agency of Africans in international politics. The class is arranged roughly chronologically.
The opening weeks set out major themes of the course, such as the nature of African nationalism and the outcomes of decolonization, before moving onto debates about development, modernisation, and culture in the African context. The class then considers several thematic case studies, which explore the causes of war, and conflict resolution, in southern Africa before finishing off with a discussion of the repercussions of the Cold War for the African continent.
We'll look in detail at the decolonisation in British and French Africa, before looking in some depth at the upheaval in the Congo. We'll also investigate the ‘diplomacy of liberation’, employed by African revolutionaries from the Portuguese colonies and South Africa to achieve majority rule and independence; examine the onset of the civil war in Angola and the struggle against apartheid in South Africa.
While the course will deal with the policies of the Soviet Union and the United States in Africa, its main objective is to study the diplomacy, strategies and statecraft of Africans in the twentieth century and investigate their impact on the ‘Global Cold War’. Were Africans simply proxies of superpower competition or did they use diplomacy to their own advantage?
The class thus aims to assess the ways in which the Cold War affected the processes of decolonisation, nation-building and democratisation in Africa. It also studies the importance of the continent for the global struggles and transformations of the post-War era. The course also allows students to creatively engage with a growing body of secondary literature and documentary evidence.

The wide ranging and continually changing nature of additional support will be examined so that students can reflect more critically on their own practice. Informed reflection is, we believe, an essential component of enhanced practice to ensure we adopt socially just practices.
Understanding Inclusive Education
20 credits
This module focuses on the changing field of inclusive education/educational support. There will be an exploration of the concepts of inclusion and of additional support needs in their entirety and in the ways in which these are exemplified in policy and practice. The intention is to help teachers to see the policies and practices of the field in relation to the ideas that lie behind them and be better placed to understand the research and theoretical background. Students will critique these in the context of their own practitioner environments.
Providing Effective Educational Support
20 credits
This module will focus on the question of how education practitioners can best respond to societal injustices that impact on children through children centred approaches with families, and alongside other child and health services. The focus will be on learning about anti-discriminatory, strength-based, rights-focussed support that is holistic, collaborative, inclusive, and socially just. Students will gain an understanding of policies such as GIRFEC and staged intervention models, and consider their implications for practice. Teaching on this module is both face to face and online.
Inclusive Pedagogy
20 credits
In this module participants will be encouraged to take a critical view of pedagogy and consider the processes which lead to the marginalisation and exclusion of particular children. The module is about supporting all learners through pedagogical approaches that focus on extending teaching approaches that are routinely available in classrooms in ways that might include all children as opposed to identifying specific and different approaches for some children. Students will develop an understanding of the importance of recognising and responding to the learning needs of all children, relating this learning to their own establishments and practice.

Supporting Teacher Learning (PG Cert)
The course is aimed at those involved in the support of teaching professional learning at all stages of a teacher’s career including:

student and probation mentors
continuing professional development (CPD) coordinators
professional review and development (PRD) reviewers
school leaders
local authority officers with responsibility for CPD and/or probationer and leadership development

It recognises a widening conception that the role of the teacher includes not only a central role in supporting pupil learning, but also recognises the important role that teachers can play in supporting each other’s learning. Previously, it was assumed that by virtue of knowing how to teach children teachers had also been equipped to support their colleagues’ learning. However, there is growing recognition (Donaldson, 2011; Kennedy et al., 2008) that this important role requires additional specific knowledge, understanding and skills, which form the basis of this Postgraduate Certificate.
You'll take three modules:
How Teachers Learn
20 credits
Sets the scene, encouraging participants to think about how they learn, to reflect critically on different types of learning they have experienced across their personal and professional careers. It encourages the link between classroom pedagogies and pedagogies used for working with professionals, as such focusing in on the feedback loop between practitioners and students to support a metacognitive approach – closely related to the professional learning model. The assignment asks students to read around an area of interest, focusing on 3 representative articles, and to personally reflect on how these ideas influence their understanding of the theory and practice of teacher learning.
Contemporary Contexts for Teacher Learning and Teachers' Work
20 credits
Builds on module 1 by facilitating a lens for looking at these pedagogies and experiences of teacher learning that reflects current policy and wider international education agendas. We also focus on the local influencers around community and student voice and what it means to engage in and with research when inhabiting a professional learning space. Throughout the module, students are supported to engage critically with education policy and the processes by which it is created; they are encouraged to question new education reform agendas. The students complete an assignment in two parts, firstly a poster presentation in which they critically analyse one key policy that they find particularly relevant to their own learning and/or professional learning in their setting, followed by a written reflection on the core ideas within the poster, supported by reference to academic literature and policy documents. Students are encouraged to engage with each other’s posters and provide collaborative peer feedback, which can be used to inform the critical reflection.
Supporting Professional Learning in the Workplace
20 credits
Takes the issues and skills developed in modules 1 and 2 and asks the participants to generate their own practitioner enquiry question, sensitive to their own setting, to support colleagues’ professional learning. The type of professional learning is open to the participant, but they are assessed on their rationale and through a practitioner enquiry approach supported in evaluating its success. Reflection is based on perceived successes of colleagues’ learning as well as their own learning when engaging in supporting others’ learning.
Successful completion of all three modules gives GTCS Professional Recognition.

Understanding Gender and Sexuality in Education
20 credits
This module, co-taught with Prof Yvette Taylor, offers an in-depth introduction to contemporary issues of gender and sexuality across different educational settings. Gender and sexuality in education have long been subject to critical attention from education studies researchers, interdisciplinary social scientists, feminists and LGBTQ+ activists. Meanwhile, diversity and inclusion have become central concerns of government policy and educational practice. In contemporary policy-practice in Scotland, gender inequalities, diversity and LGBTQ+ inclusion are under the spotlight as priorities for schools, teachers, and a variety of educational practitioners.
The module introduces key concepts and we will critically consider a full range of theoretical, research-based, policy, and practice approaches to understanding core questions and debates about gender and sexuality in education. In taking this module, you will engage with current policy directives and learn to situate these in relation to a broader landscape of equalities legislation, as well as to synthesise research evidence and complex ideas in order to explore the practical possibilities and limitations for putting such policy into practice. The module will facilitate students’ development of skills with which to critically evaluate different approaches to gender and sexuality in education.
Delivered between October and December, with assessment completed in January.

Globalisation, Society & Education Policy
In this module, you'll be introduced to globalisation and the way in which this impacts on the policymaking process. You'll be encouraged to develop a critical stance towards the ways in which policy is constructed, enacted and formed, and you'll be given the opportunity to examine a range of readings on policy and the political process. 
This module will enable you to examine social and educational policy for its impacts on the learner and teacher and the ways in which such impacts are part of the global web.

Thinking about education
The module aims to enable students to reflect in a historically informed, deeply systematic philosophical way about the phenomenon, the theory and the practice of education.
It establishes the foundation of a conscious and reflected practice of educating and teaching as well as a basis for serious and far-reaching academic research within the field of Education Studies. Topics include:

Education Studies as discipline
Education and Education Studies
The Student
The Educator/ Teacher
The Act of Educating/ Teaching
The Object of Education/ Teaching
Education Theory in Context
Issues in Contemporary Education


Frameworks for Understanding Learning
This class is designed to extend your critical understanding of learning, coming to view it as a process which can be analysed and explained via multiple perspectives. It'll focus on applying research concepts and evidence to explain learning in practical situations. Topics include:

Historical perspectives on learning
The behaviourist framework
Memory and cognition
The constructivist and social constructivist framework
Active and situated learning
The role of knowledge transfer
Metacognition
Networked learning and identity
Biological perspectives on learning


Research Methods & Reasoning 
This class provides support in developing a critical and informed understanding of research methods in relation to your own planned dissertation project.
It also provides support in understanding research ethics and how they relate to your own research and provides support in meeting the requirements of the ethical approval process.

Philosophy of Technology & Education
This module aims to enable students to develop a deep understanding of the philosophical issues raised by the understanding, affordances, and uses technology within education. The module will encourage substantive philosophical debate on a range of technologies and their application in education.
The technologies that arise within educational practice today raise a set of important questions around the nature of the learning society and how learning and technology have become mutually defined, questions that are increasingly urgent in the context of the development of 'Scotland's Digital Future', a strategy to prepare Scottish society for technological change.
Students in education need to understand how technological thinking shapes their practices if they are to become critical about the future direction of our technological and learning society. As technology is embedded ever more upon educational environments, the wider debates are increasingly urgent. As the world becomes increasingly globalised, and technologies employed more widely, the demand for courses of this nature is bound to increase.

Education & Self-Formation in Cultural Contexts
The module aims to enable students to identify, understand, and critically reflect on the ways the cultural sphere shapes and influences the (trans)formation of the self. With regard to the influence the cultural sphere has on personal development, there are two different perspectives that need to be reflected by those interested in the self-formation of the individual. On one hand, they need to reflect on the models of (trans)formative processes presented or maybe even prevalent in their own culture: How are educational processes depicted, understood, represented in modern culture, what characterises those processes in the eyes of the culture?
On the other hand, it needs to be understood what models of personality are represented, and how those cultural representations actually influence those who live and grow within this specific cultural sphere. In providing the opportunity to engage with this kind of hermeneutic analysis, the module establishes the foundation of a conscious and reflected practice of educating and teaching as well as a basis for serious, far-reaching and interdisciplinary academic research within the field of Education Studies.
The module attempts to add a more critical perspective with regard to the formative aspects of the cultural sphere and the structures of power inscribed in it. The need for this has been increasingly discussed within the international research community (Cultural Studies, Post-Colonial Studies, Gender & Queer Studies, Critical Whiteness, etc).

Putting Theory into Practice
This is the first of two optional work-based learning modules, available to students studying MSc Educational Studies.
Students should expect to explore: 

How learning works
Components of effective teaching

We will look at what we know from research about pupil engagement, interactions and questioning and assessment in contributing to effective learning and teaching. We will be reflecting upon the impact of different approaches. Students will identify an area for professional learning, to build up their own knowledge and understanding of an aspect of pedagogy. They will be encouraged to access research /theory perspectives around their chosen area to present on the implications for theory own practice from their learning.
This is where students will consider the various components that contribute to effective learning and teaching and have a go themselves at building skills in these areas. They will be encouraged to implement what they have learned from their professional learning.
Students will have the opportunity to plan, deliver and review episodes of learning, applying what they have learned about effective questioning and interactions in teaching as well as deploying formative assessment approaches to determine the success of their teaching sessions. 
Students will be encouraged to develop a professional learning plan to support their next steps, prior to the second module, professionalism and Professional Learning.

Professionalism and Professional learning
As part of the MSc Education Studies, this optional module will explore the professional roles of a teacher, as well as encouraging professional learning through practitioner inquiry. The module will run in Semester 2 following on from “Putting Theory into Practice” from Semester 1.
Students will examine in a critical way the aspects of professional commitment and values, knowledge and understanding and skills and abilities build to form the identity of a teacher.  Students will explore what the aspects look like in practice and how the range of dispositions sit along with theory and practice.  We will look at what professionalism means for teachers in a range of contexts.  Students will be introduced to a model of Professional practitioner enquiry, and consider the place, purpose and principles underpinning this.
The module will aim to:

Provide creative spaces for students to practise evidence-based enquiry, to establish on-going proactive professional approaches 
Encourage students to be change agents, from evidence-based enquiry
Encourage students to recognise the power of professional learning and enquiry
Support students in critically reflecting on both theory and their own practice 


Alternative Education
This module addresses the growing trend towards provision of education outside the mainstream. The module invites students to reflect on education and its established norms, and to consider what makes education ‘alternative’ (and what is meant by ‘mainstream’). The module explores the rationale of ‘alternative education’ through a study of philosophies, practices and pedagogies that choose 'non-traditional' ways of thinking or practice in the realms of formal and informal education.
The aim is to help learners recognise the existence of alternate education practices and understand why they are deemed so, and to enable learners to consider the implications, benefits and challenges of such classifications. 
This module will prepare students to explore the territory of alternative education, the various ways in which education gets labelled as alternative and look at learnings that could be useful to them as educators both in the formal or alternative spaces.

Philosophy of Technology and Education
This module aims to enable students to develop a deep understanding of the philosophical issues raised by the understanding, affordances, and uses technology within education. The module will encourage substantive philosophical debate on a range of technologies and their application in education.
The technologies that arise within educational practice today raise a set of important questions around the nature of the learning society and how learning and technology have become mutually defined, questions that are increasingly urgent in the context of the development of 'Scotland's Digital Future', a strategy to prepare Scottish society for technological change.
Students in education need to understand how technological thinking shapes their practices if they are to become critical about the future direction of our technological and learning society. As technology is embedded ever more upon educational environments, the wider debates are increasingly urgent. As the world becomes increasingly globalised, and technologies employed more widely, the demand for courses of this nature is bound to increase.

Educational Perspectives & Policies
This module will enable appropriate progress toward being able to demonstrate a greater ability to work independently. It will provide knowledge that covers and integrates most, if not all, of the main policies, and theoretical questions and issues raised by the study of education – including its features, boundaries and terminology. Participants will be able to apply in a professional context, a critical understanding of the principal policies, theories, concepts and principles of education in schools.

Principles & Policy in Practice
Principles and Policies in Practice (PPP) is the companion module to Educational Perspectives and Policies (EPP) and shares a focus on critical professional engagement informed by educational research and theory.

Professional Specialisation
Students will apply critical analysis, evaluation and synthesis to forefront issues in school education, through links to the particular area of specialisation. The module will enable participants to critically review, consolidate and extend knowledge, skills, practices and thinking in school education contexts and reflect critically on this in terms of their own personal and professional development.

Professional Project
The project is designed to make a significant contribution to fulfilling the main aims of the course by furthering students’ development of a questioning, self-evaluative and reflective approach to professional practice in a piece of work demanding independent, self-motivated study and the application of research and enquiry skills.
On the basis of critical understanding already developed, students will be expected to exercise their professional judgement to identify, conceptualize, develop and complete a small scale research project investigating a specific topic of their own choosing, which will add to professional knowledge in the chosen area.

Leadership for Equity, Inclusion & Social Justice
This module will focus upon education for all, inclusive pedagogy, children’s rights and issues of equity and social justice as they pertain to education and the role of leadership in furthering these important ends.

Strategic Leadership
This module focuses upon vision, values, school culture, managing people and managing change effectively. The outcome will be a proposal to instigate a strategic change initiative within the work setting.

Sensor Technologies 
A range of different sensors covering electrical, electromagnetic, environmental and mechanical measurements will need to be deployed to achieve efficient management of a power system as we transition to a de-centralised system. This module will provide the student with a broad appreciation of modern sensor technologies and their implementation in industrially relevant applications. It will cover the fundamentals of metrology and traceability, sensor characteristics and limitations, review of commonly used sensors and physical operating principles, and sensor signal conditioning. Examples of ultrasonic and photonic sensors for non-destructive evaluation of components and asset management applications will also be covered.

Power Electronics Devices, Drives and Machines 
Students will develop understanding in the principles of common power electronic systems and gain familiarity with the techniques required to analyse common power electronic circuits. The operating principles of common DC and AC machines will be investigated, so that techniques required to analyse DC and AC machines will be gained. Basic principles of generalised machine theory, and the link between DC and AC machines models will be explored. Students will also develop knowledge in the operation of power electronics used to control electrical machines and drives; along with understanding in the combination of machines and power electronics required to achieve speed and torque control in drive systems.

Project Scoping
This module will cover the following items and item selected according to the project in question:

Safety, risk assessment and COSHH
Scientific document preparation using software and information technologies relevant to the project: document preparation software, imaging and statistical software, data presentation with relevant error analysis, use of computational/simulation tools

Creativity & Venture Planning 
This class is important in terms of presenting an introduction for MSc students to the entrepreneurial process, from creative thinking to the development of a new business concept. This class has further thematic additions based on consultation with industry, specifically prototyping and storyboarding.

Mindset Lab
Mindsets are at the core of everything that people think and do. Therefore, if we want to steer entrepreneurial behaviour towards success, we need to start by shaping the mindsets of those who start ventures.  From government agencies to investment panels, entrepreneurial mindsets are quickly becoming the buzzword that everyone wants to know about.  But what are those mindsets? And when are they a force for good or otherwise?
In this research-based class, you'll be exposed first hand to the daily struggles and successes of early-stage entrepreneurs and will be tasked with assessing their mindsets, how those mindsets are shaped by context and how, in turn, they shape the behaviour of the entrepreneur. You'll take a fascinating journey through the latest academic thinking on mindsets and will apply that thinking to the practice you observe in the entrepreneurs you will be following. Theory and practice will inform each other as you discover the often hidden power of the mind on human fears, goals, failures and achievements.

Issues & Trends in Entrepreneurship, Innovation & Technology 
This module provides a firm foundation in scholarly, practitioner and policy perspectives for "mega-trends" in entrepreneurship, innovation and technology. This is a student-driven class, where you'll develop research and presentation skills, and learn about cutting-edge developments such as digital health technology, the sharing economy and social innovation, while also learning how entrepreneurial ecosystems function.

Data Lab
As increasing volumes of data are collected and made available to the public, identifying opportunities through analysis of data is a necessary skill for the contemporary entrepreneur. This course will empower students with a range of different analytic methods and software tools that will allow them to successfully identify high-value data-drive entrepreneurial opportunities.

Strategic Innovation Management
This module is designed to build knowledge of the processes underpinning innovation. The class will provide an introduction to the main concepts and frameworks related to definitions, processes, strategies, organisation and sources of innovation. Towards the end of the class, new trends in innovation, such as social innovation and frugal innovation, will also be covered.

Entrepreneurial Finance
This class addresses how startups and small businesses source and manage finances. Finance is a core function within most organisations and is especially pivotal for startups and SMEs that need to carefully navigate to survive and grow. The class is a core Semester 2 module. It builds on Semester 1 modules that address the foundational elements required to develop a promising new business concept (e.g. Creativity and New Venture Planning, Innovation, Entrepreneurial Mindset, etc.) by bringing in the finance toolkit required to make a successful business out of a good idea.

Social Entrepreneurship 
There is a growth in the number of entrepreneurs starting businesses with social and environmental purposes. This module examines ideas and practices for addressing social needs. These include social enterprises, collaborative innovation networks, hubs, digital platforms, and support intermediaries. The module is centred around how students can start their own social entrepreneurship projects. The module will consist of a selection of presentations and discussions around social innovation and social entrepreneurship.

Internationalisation & Growth
In today’s globalised business world, ventures often face international competition for inception, as well as being offered international opportunities from inception. Therefore, internationalisation is no longer the premise of larger, more established corporations. More and more often, firms internationalise early in their life cycle to explore and exploit business opportunities abroad and strengthen their competitive position in the domestic and foreign markets.
The internationalisation and growth lab will provide participants with the tools and techniques required to found globally-oriented businesses from launch.

Virtual Incubator Project
The Virtual Incubator Project is the culmination of the programme. Here, you'll be expected to put into practice all of the skills and knowledge developed over the previous nine months in order to bring a business proposition to an investment panel. You're expected to identify a suitable business idea, use primary and secondary market research for validation, and demonstrate your ability to develop the infrastructure to operationalise and grow your business. It's an accelerated incubation program run in partnership with the Entrepreneurship Accelerator Hub at the Royal Bank of Scotland. 
Over the six-week period, you'll work to go from an initial idea to investable business opportunity. In weeks 4 and 6 you'll present a working proposal to different investor audiences with the final pitch in week 6 being delivered to the Scottish EDGE panel. During the incubation period, you'll occasionally have access to ‘hot-desk’ facilities at the Entrepreneurial Hub in the city centre, and we encourage you to network, learn and support the other entrepreneurs-in-residence. 
Most of the six-week period will be self-directed time for you to research and validate your ideas. Formal activities will predominately take place on Wednesdays, where you'll attend workshops, soundboard sessions with the academic team, and social events.

Work, Wellbeing and New Technology
This class explores the social implications of renewable energy technologies by critically evaluating the new opportunities and risks for work, employment, health and wellbeing associated with large, industrial scale projects and with localised, community energy alternatives. The class engages with practitioners across academic disciplines and the energy sector, and facilitates students from business and engineering working in interdisciplinary groups to assess changing technology and changing employment practices and their impacts of social wellbeing. A unique element of this class is that it includes a four-day field study to the Isle of Eigg (an island in the Inner Hebrides, off the west coast of Scotland) in April, that will provide practical experience for students’ group project work. Note there is a cost associated with this class (cost for 2017-18 has not yet been confirmed, but as a guide in 2016-17 it was £175 to cover field trip costs of transport, accommodation and food).

Environmental Economics

The main objective of this class is to provide a grounding in the economics of the environment. It demonstrates what economic analysis can contribute to discussions about the use of our natural capital (or environmental resource) base, and to discussions about policy responses to environmental problems.
A key element of the economic approach to environmental policy is ‘value for money’ - designing policy interventions that give the greatest environmental improvement for any particular budget outlay. But economic analysis also deals with questions about sustainability (and so impacts on future generations) and equity between different individuals, groups, and countries.
This class pays particular attention to international environmental problems. Such problems have been high on the agenda for environmental policy interventions since the Rio Summit of 1992, yet are ones that seem to be the most difficult to make progress with. We examine why this has been the case, making use of the growing literature on international environmental agreements.
The class adopts a practical, applied orientation throughout. Applications include transport policy, water quality and availability, global climate change, and loss of biological diversity.

Public Health Studies*
This class, run by the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, develops students’ understanding of public and environmental health, and the multidisciplinary approach in preventative and proactive action to safeguarding public health.
A diverse range of subjects are covered ranging from the risk assessment approach taken with respect to protecting the public from private water supplies, to the role of environmental health professionals in the prevention of the spread of infectious disease.
The class also provides students with fundamental knowledge regarding Health Improvement/Promotion and Health Protection, including the different methods used and the variety of agencies involved.

Qualitative & Quantitative Research Methods 
In this class, run by the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, students will acquire familiarity with, and practice of, research techniques, and examine different ways of, and gain experience in, presenting research results.
The class discusses the key principles, and practical exercises, on both quantitative and qualitative research methods, including survey methods, interviewing techniques, use of census data and statistical methods.
The class also includes discussion of ethical issues.
Finally, there is dissertation-related teaching on choosing a research question and a research method, and writing a research proposal. This is a semester 1 and 2 class but meetings do not take place every week.

New Venture Creation 
The New Venture Creation class, run by the Hunter Centre for Entrepreneurship, is designed to provide a practical introduction to business modelling and understanding how new ventures are developed. The class is multi-disciplinary in nature and integrates within it the main business disciplines. It focuses upon the processes within new businesses but draws comparisons with larger organisations and as such introduces a more entrepreneurial approach to the career patterns of individuals who pursue careers in larger organisations.
The class will not follow the more traditional lecture pattern but will be highly interactive with class participants being involved in individual and group activities. These will encourage creative thinking and “learning by doing” in addressing the real opportunities and challenges that face the first-time entrepreneur. This class considers the nature of business planning and deals with the business planning process. It's a project-based course in which students, working in small groups, research and develop a business plan for a new venture. Students will select a business idea and develop it into a business model.

Creativity & Innovation Development
This class, run by the Hunter Centre for Entrepreneurship, introduces participants to the fundamentals of creativity and opportunity recognition. Through a blend of hands on creativity exercises, ideation tools and techniques through to models of opportunity evaluation, students will develop foundational entrepreneurship skills.

Advanced Entrepreneurial Finance
Research shows that the main reasons for closing a business venture are lack of profitability and failure to raise funding. Most entrepreneurs are raising funding and dealing with investors for the first time, but the investors do this for a living. The power balance is thus tipped against the entrepreneur. This class provides knowledge and skills to empower entrepreneurs in their consideration of and dealings with the various funders. It does so by helping students to understand the mechanics of sophisticated funding methods for entrepreneurs, including bank funding, government funding, business angels and venture capital, as well as crowdfunding, customer funding and other alternative finance. In this class, students simulate being investors, and also learn to plan strategically for maximum value at exit.

Energy Economics 
Energy resources (such as crude oil, natural gas, coal, biomass, wind and sunlight) can be harvested and converted into useful forms to produce energy commodities (such as petroleum and diesel fuel, natural gas, and electricity) that can be used to provide energy services for human activities.
The class begins by studying the forces that generate both demand for and supply of energy resources and energy commodities. It considers what factors determine the way those commodities are transported to users, and how residuals are disposed of. It investigates the roles of alternative market and regulatory structures on these activities, the impacts of such activities and their environmental consequences.
The class identifies criteria required for the efficient provision and use of energy commodities and resources and reasons why efficiency is rarely achieved. The class adopts a practical, applied orientation throughout. Applications include the evaluation of renewable energy projects and the economic analysis of nuclear power.

Energy Resources & Policy 
Against the background of international commitments on atmospheric emissions, diminishing fossil fuel resources and the liberalisation of energy markets, this class examines sustainable options for energy production, supply and consumption.
The aim is to give students an understanding of current trends, and to enable a critical evaluation of emerging ideas, technologies and policies.

Entrepreneurial leadership & resource management
The class, run by the Hunter Centre for Entrepreneurship, will expand students' understanding of the differences and complementarities between successful leadership and the effective management of entrepreneurial capital and resources in various entrepreneurial contexts. Significant emphasis will be on the development of practical skills applicable in diverse contexts.

Financial Analysis of a Company 
For this project you will be supplied with data relating to some issue in finance or accounting, and a preliminary list of hypothesis or questions to be addressed. You will be expected to expand the range of hypotheses to be considered and ways in which the hypothesis can be tested. 
Whilst all members of the class will consider the same issue the data sets will differ from one person to another. By providing the data, and a broadly defined research agenda, the research project allow considerably more time to be spent on the analysis of the data and interpretation of results than is feasible in the context of a more conventional dissertation. While the challenge of identifying a research topic and the development of an appropriate data set are to a large extent eliminated it does allow the analytical work to be developed in more depth. The introductory class will review briefly the analysis and techniques that will be relevant for the research work to be undertaken.

Case study/ Literature Review
This project provides you with the opportunity to choose a topic to study in some depth.  It can take the form of

a review of the literature on some topic in finance (e.g. Some recent developments in the financial markets)
a case study (e.g. the sub-prime crisis)
a consideration of some area of controversy (e.g. the regulation of financial institutions)

In completing the third project you are expected to demonstrate an understanding of the concepts and analysis developed on the course, a comprehensive knowledge of the relevant literature on the chosen topic, and an ability to discuss issues in some area of finance or accounting on an informed basis.

Project Methodology

Project 1: Finance & Project 2: Management
These projects provide you with a valuable opportunity to apply what you have learned through the taught modules to a more practical situation. Working under the supervision of a faculty member, you'll spend time working individually, or in a group, on a topic of central interest in these areas. You'll learn the skills needed to develop a proposal and conduct an effective enquiry into your topic areas, producing reports that are both informed and practical.
Project subject matters are diverse, with a vast array of industries and topics to consider. While many projects can be subject specific, increasingly, many projects are undertaken with organisations, which allow you to learn more about a specific industry or work with a particular company.
Our experience shows that such interactions often act as a catalyst for future career opportunities. While you'll be encouraged to put forward your own suggestion of a company, we do have client projects on offer, so are more than happy to assist you in identifying appropriate clients and partnerships.

Media & Health
The topic of health is a constant fixture in the media through news and features, documentaries, talk shows, and more. Audience demand for health information is high, as is the relevance of this coverage to their lives, and therefore the responsibility of journalists towards their audiences. This class will highlight all these issues and emphasize many of the inherent conflicts in health journalism and heath communication.
The goal of this class is to examine the potential and limits of the media to accomplish health education of the public. We will examine how both information and entertainment media present and frame various health behaviours and how that affects media consumers. We will look at how theories, models, and assumptions of mass communication relate to public health issues. Topics to be covered include scientific inquiry, the media vs. science, framing illness, body image, stigma, entertainment education, mythologizing doctors, and others.
Assessment will include three pieces: a research paper on the media coverage of a health issue chosen by the student, a research paper on the public knowledge of the same health issue, and a poster presentation of the findings from the two research papers.

War, Sacrifice and the Nation in Europe, 1789-1918
        This class explores the changing concepts of death in war in the European conflicts between the French Revolution and the First World War. From being left on battlefields to being granted permanent resting-places and being remembered in war memorials, this period saw fundamental shifts in practices and attitudes towards soldiers’ death in war. Students will therefore analyse the efforts to create meaning for soldiers’ sacrifices and to inspire future generations to follow in their footsteps. The underlying themes of this class will be the emergence of national sentiment and national consciousness and the role of religion in concepts of sacrifice in war. The class will focus upon Europe (including Britain), but comparisons will also be made with the American Civil War, in which treatment of the war dead and memorialisation shifted fundamentally, prefiguring changes that were to occur with the Franco-Prussian War only a few years later.

We draw on theoretical developments in the study of justice and punishment and explore their potential to illuminate and inform processes of progressive penal change.
The module examines contemporary changes, international evidence and policy transfer, and technological challenges and considers reform across the globe. The module draws on insights and perspectives including law, the sociology of punishment, history and the social sciences.
Learning is conducted through a range of innovative methods such as debates and media representations. The module is supplemented by visits to key institutions' prisons, women’s justice centres, as well as conferences with key practitioners and policy makers.

Childhood and Crime
Youth justice attracts interest across society, politically, socially and legally. Some issues – from the murder of two year old James Bulger in 1993 by two 10 year old children to the riots in 2011 in England – spark moral panic and demonstrate the extent to which such matters cut across disciplinary boundaries and influence legal and societal responses to children who offend. 
Youth justice generates its own philosophical approaches eg in the welfare / justice debate. It also provides a context within which to examine broader issues affecting criminal justice as a whole such as the need to balance the rights of the accused against the public interest. 
This class will provide an opportunity for you to critically examine some key aspects of youth justice law, policy and philosophy from a number of perspectives. Your learning will be supplemented by visits to custodial and innovative community settings, as well as a visit to and a simulation of Scotland’s unique system of ‘Children’s Hearings’ (a decision-making system based on the best needs of the child).

Surveillance, Technology and Crime Control
Surveillance and the use of technology in criminal justice is becoming increasingly important.
This module focuses on aspects of surveillance studies that inform the study criminal justice and penal change. If it's true that surveillance is ethically and politically problematic, how can or should it be used? Contemporary forms are stimulated by technological developments that were unavailable in earlier eras, whose deployment and consequences are, as yet, only beginning to be understood. Is increased surveillance inevitable? What is its impact on privacy and patterns of social exclusion? How can it be used for benign, even progressive objectives? 
The module focuses on theoretical understandings of surveillance, selected substantive aspects of it, patterns of resistance to it, and forms of regulation of it that have emerged in relation to it, including privacy and human rights concerns. Learning is supplemented by visits to the CCTV monitoring centre and Electronic Monitoring centre.

Narrative processing across Languages and Cultures
Narrative processing is a field which has seen significant advances in recent years in psychology and neuroscience (eg Zwaan, situation models) and narratology (eg Ryan and transmedia narrative).
These bodies of research converge on the many ways in which narratives across cultures and media can be seen to share universal features. However, there is an even older body of work, deriving ultimately from Bartlett's memory studies, and developing through folklore and anthropology, which illustrates how narrative meaning and interpretation changes as it moves between social settings, media and cultures (Bauman, Barber).
This class invites you to engage with these three approaches critically, to form views on their implications for the use of narratives between cultural groups, and to consider potential practical applications for your findings.

Introduction to Intercultural Communication
This class critically applies the linguistic theory of communication, and theoretical approaches to culture, to a range of problems in intercultural communication. We explore what a culture is, and whether cultures differ systematically. We learn about the linguistic theory of communication, and approaches to discourse and conversation, and speech acts, including ways in which these differ between cultures.
We consider how face and politeness can be theorized, and how they differ between cultures. We look at how languages differ, and whether differences in language lead to differences in thought. We look at the self, and identity, and their relation to culture and cultural difference, and we see how mobilities relate to intercultural communication.
This class is relevant for those who aim to teach English to speakers of other languages who need to understand issues around intercultural communication. It is also relevant to those studying literature who want to understand how communication works, particularly in the culturally complex situations in which literature can arise.

Environmental Economics

The main objective of this class is to provide a grounding in the economics of the environment. It demonstrates what economic analysis can contribute to discussions about the use of our natural capital (or environmental resource) base, and to discussions about policy responses to environmental problems.
A key element of the economic approach to environmental policy is ‘value for money’ - designing policy interventions that give the greatest environmental improvement for any particular budget outlay. But economic analysis also deals with questions about sustainability (and so impacts on future generations) and equity between different individuals, groups, and countries.
This class pays particular attention to international environmental problems. Such problems have been high on the agenda for environmental policy interventions since the Rio Summit of 1992, yet are ones that seem to be the most difficult to make progress with. We examine why this has been the case, making use of the growing literature on international environmental agreements.
The class adopts a practical, applied orientation throughout. Applications include transport policy, water quality and availability, global climate change, and loss of biological diversity.
