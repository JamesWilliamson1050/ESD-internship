Analytical Chemistry & Drugs of Abuse
This class covers the fundamental analytical methods and advanced theories in chromatography, mass spectrometry and electro-separations. It introduces you to the concept of experimental design and its application in analytical, forensic and preparative chemistry, and how to perform analytical calculations and interpret data.
The analytical procedures used to identify substances controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001, the Medicines Act 1968 and the World Anti-Doping Agency. You’ll be introduced to methods of clandestine synthesis and how drug profiling can identify the synthetic route used. The pharmacology of drugs of abuse and the various biological matrices used in drug screening will also be described.
