Corporate Financing, This class will cover theories of capital structure, sources of capital (debt and equity), and corporate payout policy at an advanced level. The starting point for this class will be Modigliani-Miller assumptions introduced in Business Finance, and course material will highlight how the relaxation of these assumptions leads to formal models on corporate financing behaviour under imperfect capital markets. The emphasis will be upon the ideas necessary to analyse the firm’s financing decisions. It discusses financial structure and the alternative mechanisms for distributing corporate wealth to shareholders.

Sessions are weekly and three hours in length.The sessions are thematically linked to the pathways for individualised experience in third year whilst also drawing on the theoretical knowledge developed in MDP 1. In order to develop understanding, organisations will deliver a half-day session. This consists of a one hour plenary introduction where the company and case study are introduced. This is followed by the group sessions where you undertake activities in relation to the case study set by the company.
Management Development Programme 3, The third year of centres on individualised experience in an organisational context through one of the following pathways:Internship/Charities - gain practical experience in a private or third sector organisation. You need to negotiate and locate your own organisation and experience – this is one of the key learning points of the pathway.Research and consultancy - a facility for local small businesses to gain from the experience and expertise of those within SBS. You work on two live business consultancy projects (one in each semester) and, as a team of 6, develop solutions and strategic initiatives for the local SME economy.International experience – only available for students who are undertaking an international exchange for either one semester or full year.Vertically Integrated Projects - working on a cross-faculty basis to research longitudinal projects (including the ‘Bill Gates Toilet Challenge, Solar Panels for Gambia and Enterprise in Schools) you work with a team of students from all levels of study (first year undergraduate to final year PhD) to further the work of the project.In addition, you’re required to undertake a social responsibility element (this accounts for one quarter of the overall workload).These have been designed to provide support to the Curriculum for Excellence and the Widening Access to Higher Education programme. There are no formal classes for MDP3 although there is pathway support with the pathway leads and tutor support.

Microeconomics 4, Game Theory and Information Economics, the topics of this class, consider market failure resulting from two different sources: individuals pursuing their own self-interest at the expense of others; and information asymmetry which alters the way agents behave. Methods to alleviate these market failures will also be considered.
Macroeconomics 4, This class aims to provide you with the required tools to understand current macroeconomic issues, such as the interactions between the banking sector and monetary policy or the policy responses to the global financial crisis.  Throughout the class, the analytical usefulness of the theoretical models taught is illustrated with real-world examples.
Introduction to Econometrics, This class builds upon the empirical content of Macroeconomics 2 and further develops your ability to analyse economic data. In addition, this class lays the foundations for further study of econometrics at Honours level.
Economics of Firms & Industries, This class introduces you to different industry structures and studies the behaviour of firms within those structures.  The material builds on the study of the theory of the firm presented in Microeconomics 2 and provides a foundation for the study of industrial organisation at Honours level.
Industrial Economics,         This course investigates the actions that firms in an industry might take to preserve their profit in that industry, and the implications that this has for competition policy and regulation. We take an analytical approach to the issues which will be supported by examining case studies and current events.    This course will investigate the actions firms can take in markets with the aim of maintaining their market power by deterring entry of additional firms. A modern approach recognises that each firm faces competing firms who all have similar motives.After briefly reviewing industry market structures to provide the basis of the analysis, issues of entry deterrence will be considered, including the role of advertising, issues associated with research and development, anti-trust and both vertical integration and horizontal mergers. The course will conclude with an investigation of regulatory measures that can be put in place to limit anti-competitive strategies, and consider the role of competition policy.

Applied Econometrics, In the third year econometrics class you’ll have learned about regression in both a cross-sectional data and time series data context. This class extends that knowledge in three ways.First, for cross-sectional data, the class deals with regression techniques where the dependent variable may be restricted or limited in some way. In such cases, the regression model as taught in the third year class is not appropriate; this class develops models which are similar in spirit to the standard regression model, but can handle all of these cases.A second purpose of Applied Econometrics is to develop regression methods which can be used when you have panel data - consisting of both cross-sectional and time-series dimensions.Third, the class will build on the introduction to the econometrics of time series data developed in this class by developing two classes of models.
Financial Development & Economic Growth, This class gives a balanced view of the role of finance in promoting long-run economic growth, but also booms and busts. The nature and role of financial intermediaries will be introduced, and, afterwards, formally addressed in a simple aggregate growth model. Empirical evidence will be examined, before turning to the specifics of micro-finance. The importance of financial globalisation will also be investigated. Finally, the rest of the class will be devoted to deciphering the causes and consequences of the current financial crisis.
Behavioural Economics, Behavioural Economics offers alternative theories that merge psychological insights with economic theory and are based on experimental and other evidence, that attempt to provide a better explanation of real-world behaviour.This class is concerned with exploring these new behavioural theories with the aim of providing you with an expanded toolkit with which to approach ‘real-world Economics’ that is based on the burgeoning Behavioural Economics literature that has emerged over the past two or three decades.After studying this, you should be able to extend much of your previously-learned knowledge in Microeconomics in various directions that take into account more realistic ways of modelling how individuals behave.
Natural Resource, Environmental & Energy Economics, The class provides you with an introduction to natural resource, environmental and energy economics and policy. It focuses on the contributions of economics to understanding environmental, energy and resource problems, their causes, and the design of effective public policies to counteract them.
Introduction to Hospitality & Tourism Management, This class introduces you to key issues and concepts in relation to hospitality and tourism management. Gradually you're immersed into the sector and key issues while you apply theories from different fields to the understanding of Hospitality and Tourism. 
Service Encounter Management, In the hospitality and tourism sector, much of the customer engagement and value delivery takes place within the service encounter. In this class you'll learn how the management of this dynamic environment requires an integrated approach where customers, employees and the service setting itself require to be managed.
Destination Marketing Management, Nations, regions and cities: destinations are products for Hospitality and Tourism, inward investment and higher education. You'll explore challenges in managing and marketing destinations across organisational and product boundaries using a range of industry contexts. The destination is the core element of tourism supply. It is defined in spatial as well as cultural/symbolic terms and encompasses a wide variety of sectors such as hospitality, the built and natural environments, cultural heritage, entertainment, sport and retailing.The diverse nature of the destination and lack of central ‘control’ implies quite specific challenges and responses in its management and marketing. This class will equip students with the skills necessary to engage with these.The destination is the core element of tourism supply.

Industry Placement, You have the opportunity to gain experience working with industry professionals, to develop practical skills and reflective practice and to build networks for possible future employment. You'll reflect upon and evaluate not only your own performance, but also the organisation, its output or key activities, and broader social, cultural and economic role.
Events Management, In this class you'll work in a team to design, organise, run and evaluate your own event for charity. Through this practical exercise, you'll be exposed to the realities and challenges of events management and teamwork. This class adds to the experiential content of the Hospitality & Tourism Management programme whilst retaining rigorous theoretical underpinnings and strong coverage of events management at an advanced level.
Internationalisation of Tourism Products and Services, The distinctiveness of this class is based on its specific focus on exploring the international dimension of the hospitality and tourism industry. It brings together insights from International Business and Hospitality & Tourism Management﻿ literatures to explore how the industry has become increasingly global in its operations, and analyse the new type of players that have entered the industry. The class will enhance the current curriculum and educational structure and show developments in terms of internationalisation and the various ways technology is used in necessitating certain changes in the industry.
Hospitality & Tourism Analysis: Case Studies & Case Histories, This class uses case studies from Hospitality & Tourism and challenges aspects of learning in previous classes. It'll further your understanding and appreciation of the nature of hospitality and tourism too. It encourages reflection on some realities of hospitality and tourism which do not fit neatly into theoretical boxes. 
Being an Ethical Manager, The nature and application of business ethics in contemporary management are explored in this class. It raises key ethical issues from both cultural and stakeholder perspectives and balances them with philosophical and pragmatic considerations. It'll provide you with a clear understanding of the dichotomy between philosophical idealism and the pragmatic considerations of ethical leadership for practical management.
Management, Enterprise & the Rise of the Global Economy, Inspired by the Harvard approach to management education this class explores three principles of management:business strategies are understood through reflection on the complex realities faced by enterprises in competitive arenasfirms can only be understood within the context of market dynamicsthe contemporary situation can never be divorced from the past
Strategy & Leadership, This class will develop your knowledge of strategy and provide insights as to how current and aspiring business leaders can manage strategically. You'll have an enhanced understanding of how individuals within an organisation can effectively lead and manage strategy in a complex and challenging world.
Family Business: Theory & Practice, The hospitality and tourism industry has a large number of family businesses. Given the prevalence of family businesses – estimates suggest that almost 80% of new ventures are born as family firms and about 60% of the UK’s 4.2 million enterprises are family firms – graduates employed within the SME sector are likely to be employed by family-owned firms. The class examines the distinctive advantages and unique challenges that face family firms.
Managing People,         In recent years the task of managing employees has been made more challenging by rapid changes in the business environment. This class focuses on the contemporary and practical issues of how people are organised and managed in the workplace and examines theoretical perspectives which help our understanding of the complex relationship between the employer and employee in facilitating the organisation and production of goods and services.    
Work Psychology,         This class develops understanding of managing people from a psychological perspective through understanding behaviour, attitudes, motivation and wellbeing of people at work. Areas covered include what leads to positive employee work attitudes like job satisfaction, organisational commitment, and their outcomes in terms of work behaviour, such as job performance, withdrawal, absenteeism, turnover, fair treatment and trust.    
Work Psychology for Human Resource Management,         This class looks at applying psychological theories explaining effectiveness and well-being of people at work to Human Resource Management as an approach to managing people and the employment relationships. Areas covered include organisational and individual decision-making relating to the recruitment and selection process, the impact of performance management on employee perceptions, team working, and the impact of leadership on attitudes and trust.

In this class, you'll be exposed to concepts and ideas from economics, sociology, psychology, geography and other social sciences, all in the context of the competitive business environment.
Understanding Consumers & Markets, Many of the fundamental concepts of marketing are based on an ability to understand consumers and the marketing concept can be implemented more effectively when adequate information about the market and potential consumer behaviour is available. Marketing Research and customer information provide a critical input to the planning and development of a company's marketing strategy in relation to marketing communications, strategic marketing and branding.
Services & Retail Marketing, At the heart of this class is the recognition that services present unique challenges, and that building customer relationships through quality service is fundamental to marketing success in every organisation. Over the past decade the retail sector has been one of the most dynamic areas in business. The retail sector also provides a very clear indication of the overall health and robustness of the economy. The rise or fall of the individual’s disposable income is very quickly reflected in terms of expenditure on items. In this respect, the retail sector acts as the weather vane for the economy.
Marketing Communications in the Digital Age, This class will outline and discuss the strategic role of marketing in a digital context, and further elaborate on the integration of digital marketing, social media marketing, mobile marketing and traditional and digital marketing communications. You will learn about the enduring strategic power of marketing communications in a digital world and learn how to plan for effective, strategic communications which integrate a wide range of channels including the traditional communications mix and the extended mix including all the assets of the brand and digital opportunities.

Brand Management, The importance of brands raises significant questions of how to develop brand equity and how to communicate a branding strategy of differentiation, value and identification. The role of the Brand Manager is reviewed along with formulating the necessary communication strategies to build brand equity and secure market share.More recent approaches in this vein suggest that the traditional Brand Management approach is all too limited, leaving many questions unanswered. Consequently more recent approaches address the co-construction of brand value, through viral branding, using social media, co-branding and brand extensions. In this respect, the principles of branding are now being applied beyond simply new product development, to such strategies as places, communities and countries.Other key strategies that may be discussed include, luxury branding, nation branding, business-to-business branding and corporate brands.
Social Marketing, This course aims to build foundational knowledge of traditional commercial-oriented Marketing, by examining applications of Marketing in a social context. Each year millions of pounds are spent world-wide to combat health and social problems such as HIV/AIDS, smoking, drug and alcohol abuse and rising obesity levels. At the same time excessive consumptions burdens society with building landfills and increasing pollution. Meanwhile there are still people who consume 'too little' and who suffer from hunger.The class considers recent research in a variety of Social Marketing contexts and material is continuously updated to ensure that students gain an understanding of the most relevant and critical Social Marketing trends.
Advances in Consumer Behaviour, This class provides students with an understanding of some of the contemporary issues and challenges in understanding consumers. Building on the undergraduate Consumer Behaviour class, this module aims to develop students’ ability to analyse consumer behaviour in a variety of situations and to explore the complexity of 21st century consumption.The class reviews consumer trends and the significance of consumer culture, and then explores topics that are the focus of recent research attention. Current topics include consumer identity (possessions and body image); consumer vulnerability; postmodern consumers; consumer tribes; consumption spaces; consumers and celebrities and consumers and ethics.
Managing Customer Relationships,         The class explores the development of relationship marketing from its transactional roots and introduces concepts such as: CRM, customer loyalty, customer equity and customer perspectives on relationships. A contemporary look at relationships within marketing is introduced through examination of S-D Logic, co-creation and customer engagement, these highlight how firms build and utilise relationships with a customer ‘resource’ to create and offer increasingly more specialised and individualised offerings.    
International Business Management, This class examines the theoretical underpinnings which help explain the operations of such enterprises, covering both international business strategy and international business management. This will be achieved by exploring contemporary issues in academic thought and international business practice.
Managing Integrated Marketing Communications: Theory & Practice, The class will create a learning environment in which students can enhance their knowledge of relevant marketing communications theories and develop the necessary analytical, creative and decision-making skills required to effectively manage IMC in a variety of contexts.
Sports Marketing, This class provides you with an opportunity to study and apply marketing principles and concepts to a sector that has gained increasing significance in society world-wide. We’ve witnessed the emergence of a sports culture in many countries. This, in turn, has led to the emergence of sport as a global industry.Sport is one of the most important sectors in the UK in terms of spectator interest, participation and consumer spending. It is also a varied industry consisting of sports products as well as sports services, spectator sports, sports media and sport-related travel.
Small Business Marketing, Given the evolving nature of the job market, evidence suggests that 40% of graduates are now working in 'graduate level' jobs within SMEs. Alongside this, evidence suggests that SME graduate jobs show a concentration towards niche sectors such as marketing. As such, the aim of this class is to provide a theoretical grounding in marketing through the lens of small business organisations.By focusing on SMEs rather than larger organisations it will provide a contrast with the prevailing focus of marketing and highlight how marketing is different in a small firm and how this translates into SME marketing competencies. Upon completion of this class student will be able to pitch themselves more favourably towards SME employers.
Tourism Marketing, This class explores underlying marketing processes and builds on traditional marketing elements in the context of tourism, considering both supply (destination/ community) and demand (consumer) perspectives. The class will explore a number of theories related to both marketing and tourism, as well of the application of these theories to real world cases, to ensure students gain an enhanced understanding of the tourism industry.

Practitioner Enquiry – Exploring Research Methods, The class is embedded within a workplace culture where early learning and childcare professionals are expected to continually reflect upon themselves and others, to evaluate aspects of professional practice, skills values and commitment and to stay abreast of current knowledge, perspectives and understanding in order to lead change and improved outcomes for children. This module encourages students to consider the value of enquiry-led research approaches to professional development and practice.Evaluate current practice and formulate and frame future practice in creative and considered ways.Critically analyse and synthesise relevant knowledge and understanding and problem solve accordingly.Consider possibilities and construct informed justifications for leading change in the workplace.Examine and address ethical considerations and issues in accordance with professional ethical codes (national, local and University based).Plan, make decisions and lead change based on negotiation of meaning and dialogue with children and collaboration with other professionals and stakeholders.Communicate effectively, articulate meaning and share good practice.
Understanding Children’s Agency and Experiences within Pedagogic Culture, This module will develop an awareness of how children experience, negotiate and manoeuvre learning cultures. The central tenant running throughout the module is an exploration of the child's perspective of the learning context. It will focus on children's agency in contributing to their experiences by considering the ways that children can interact with resources, space and people to develop their learning experiences. The module is deeply rooted in conceptualisation of children and childhood (James & Prout, 2015) and how our perceptions of the child contribute to our planning and framing of children’s play experiences. By developing a relational approach to understanding what it feels like to be a child in the learning context, students will be able to analyse the competences of children as directors of their own learning in a free play context. Thus, the module is unpinned by the following themes: - The agentic role of the child as part of a pedagogic culture; - Spaces and places for child-centeredness in children’s lives and learning.
Promoting Playful Pedagogies in Practice, This module will investigate the significance of play to children’s thinking and to the development of positive learning dispositions for children of all ages. The ways in which pedagogical practices shape the play experiences of children in a variety of settings will be explored. It is vital that those who work with children understand the principles and values which underpin their work. The module will provide a professional, theoretical context in which to formalise and extend existing good practice as well as to develop new, innovative practice in supporting children’s active learning. Students will be encouraged to interrogate “accepted” practice in light of their reading, theoretical perspectives explored and discussion with their peers.
Leadership and Management in Childhood Practice, This module will explore the relationship between leadership, management and quality. It will encourage students to assess their own knowledge skills and abilities and to look at the ways in which they can support and foster the development of leadership in others within their establishment teams.
Implementing Curriculum in Practice, This module aims to strengthen students’ knowledge of pedagogy, pedagogical approaches and key subject knowledge in relation to health and wellbeing, literacy and numeracy. Consideration will be given to the way that subject knowledge, curriculum and child’s own experiences and interest’s influence how professionals lead pedagogy and curriculum whilst remaining true to the voice of the child. This module builds on course expectations that participants will critically analyse current practice in light of new and growing evidence from theory and policy.
Leading Pedagogy and the curriculum, This module will draw on relevant theories to strengthen students’ knowledge of pedagogy, pedagogical approaches and key subject knowledge in relation to health & wellbeing, literacy and numeracy.

Social Research Methods (10-credit class), This class prepares students for designing and completing a research project. It will equip students with the skills and knowledge required in planning and delivering a research project.
English 1A & 1B, These first-year classes offer an introduction to the study of English at university level.In the course of these classes you will study a range of texts in the three main genres of creative literature - poetry, prose, and drama – and will learn to engage with the critical materials that analyse them, and have the option in assessment to respond creatively to some of these work as well.Across this year you will also have an opportunity to understand how particular historical and social contexts shape literature, and to discuss ways in which historical literature continues to live and have relevance to the contemporary reader. Current texts studied in this class include Othello, Robinson Crusoe, Jane Eyre, and some contemporary song lyrics and Renaissance poetry.
Writing Through Time 1&2, These classes develop your understanding of literary criticism from our first-year classes by engaging with the question of the historical situatedness of literary production, offering an overview of key ideas, debates and literary texts from the Renaissance to the present. Once again our focus is on different genres of writing: this time, poetry, drama, and long and short prose fiction. Through these texts, you will engage with distinct modes of analysis, with literary critical approaches sitting alongside more innovative creative approaches.
The Construction of Scotland, This class offers a wide variety of ways of thinking about 'Scottishness' and Scottish national identity.

Making the Modern Human, The class aims to introduce you to changing ideas about the human in relation to two key moments in history: the concept of the idea of the beast within from the age of Shakespeare, and the emergence of Darwin's theory of evolution in the mid-nineteenth century. The class will look at shifts in understanding the boundary between humans and animals and at what that meant for how people understood themselves at two very different moments in the past. Core to the class will be how scientific, philosophical and literary materials contemplate the same ideas.
Detective Fiction, This course will trace the development of crime fiction from the mid C19th until the present day. Beginning with some of the earliest depictions, we will examine short stories by Edgar Allen Poe and Arthur Conan Doyle, before going on to look at C20th representations of the literary sleuth in Britain and the USA. We will consider well-known examples from popular culture (eg Hercule Poirot and his 'little grey cells', the stereotype of the American private-eye) as well as more experimental, postmodern examples (Thomas Pynchon’s The Crying of Lot 49 and Paul Auster's New York Trilogy).Throughout the course we will be concerned with connections between crime and the emergence of the modern city, questioning the extent to which detective fiction aims to impose a sense of rationality and closure on an otherwise uncertain and alienating world. In its concern with the social and cultural role of crime fiction, this course will also reflect on the importance of deconstructive, feminist, post-structuralist and psychoanalytic readings of the genre.
Greek Theatre to National Theatre, This class is designed to introduce students to theatre practice starting with Greek theatre through to the work of the National Theatre for Scotland. The sessions are designed to be both theoretical and practical with students engaging with activities that illuminate the textual material studied. Drama was intended to be performed and to this end, study will also include that of set design and how that has evolved over the centuries taking into account the changes in style and expectations of an audience as well as the harnessing of technological advances.Students will study in two-hour sessions to allow the theoretical underpinning to be embedded into the workshop activities and should be considered as a foundation for future study in theatre practice. The intention is to study a selection of plays, not as isolated written works, but in relation to their production and performance.The class will give students insights into evolving theatre practices, predominately in Europe, through examination and analysis of dramatic fiction and their theatrical constructs. The class will draw upon the work of playwrights that will include Euripides, Shakespeare, Moliere, Pirandello, Chekov, Brecht, Beckett, Pinter, and Greig and examine the professional practice of contemporary theatre performers and directors. The class will work alongside practice-based research on the communication of dramatic fiction through theatrical performance.
International Influences, This class teaches you how various kinds of world literature have been influential on literature in English. Each week the lecture introduces a new literature, sometimes referring to one or two specific authors, and places the foreign literature linguistically, culturally and historically. We then look at specific influences on writers in English. Sometimes we will look at translations, sometimes adaptations, including into different media, and we will see that texts can lead to other texts through complex chains of influence.Seminars often take a foreign text, and look at one or more English language variants of it.  One of the assessments is an essay involving analysis of adapted texts; the other is an essay on the more general issues which arise. Students are not expected to learn or know about any of the foreign languages involved.Topics for 2019-20 are likely to be similar to those for the current year, which includes Sappho and Homer (Greek), Catullus (Latin), Dante and Petrarch (Italian), the Hebrew Bible, Borges (and other Latin Americans), Chinese and Japanese poetry, Scottish Gaelic, Indian and other South Asian literature, and Scandinavian (including Old English) literature. 
Language in Business, This class explores the ways in which language is used in businesses and other organisations (including charities, government, education, etc.). The class also functions as an introduction to the theory of communication more generally; we explore how meaning is communicated, how texts are made coherent, why speaking is a way of acting, how conversations are structured, and how politeness is managed.We consider gender as an aspect of organisations, and how language maintains and constructs gender. We look at the use and invention of words (eg brand names), including organisational metaphors and the use of storytelling in an organisation. We consider how language and communication differ across cultures, and how this can lead to cross-cultural misunderstanding, and we ask whether different languages shape different ways of thinking; as part of this, we consider the discourses of banal nationalism.The materials we study may include websites, values statements, marketing brochures and posters, public apologies, political speeches, transcripts of e-mail interactions, and of meetings. One of the assessments is an essay involving analysis of one of these kinds of organisational discourse; the other is an essay on the more general issues which arise. Students are not expected to have any prior knowledge of linguistics or the analysis of language. 
Reading Poetry, This class will examine the tools of poetry, including voice, rhyme, meter, schemes, and tropes, in a variety of genres and periods. The aim of this course is to introduce students to the conventions of poetry and the ways in which these conventions have been subverted or modified over time, allowing for innovation and introducing new voices, such as those of women, minorities and the working classes.We will consider a number of poetic forms, such as the sonnet, the lyric, the epic, and the ode, with examples taken from the early modern to the present day. The principal aim of the class is to give students the tools required to read poetry with confidence.The course will cover the sonnet, sonnet sequences, lyric poetry, dramatic monologues, narrative poetry, epic, satire, ekphrasis, and odes and elegies, and a wide range of authors including Donne, Pope, Byron, Christina Rossetti, Tennyson, Dickinson, Poe, Siddal, Rilke, Plath, Angelou, and Atwood.
Sex, Revenge & Corruption in Renaissance Drama, This class will focus on drama, a key genre in the period from the 1580s to the closure of the playhouses in 1642. Reading work by major dramatists such as William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, Ben Jonson and Thomas Middleton, we will engage with a form that addressed both a highly literate and a popular audience, and is thus a particularly interesting place to trace ways of thinking in the period.The common thread that ties this selection of plays together is their interest in transgression: what happens when humans cross the limits set by tradition, religion and the state? In the process of this theatrical interrogation, the plays pose questions about violence, identity, gender, desire, citizenship and the role of the theatre itself. We will read tragedies and comedies, and wonder why tragedies in this period are so often comic, and why the comedies end badly.
Theories of Literature & Wellbeing, The relationship between literature and wellbeing is of interest to the a number of employers and professions, including health and social care (evidenced by the journal Medical Humanities and the 'Get into Reading' programme run by The Reader, a charity). However investigations into the potential benefits of reading or hearing literature are hampered at the moment by the lack of a theoretical base from which to start. Academic work in English and literature is growing more interdisciplinary with sustained interest in the psychology of the reading experience for example.This class combines recent academic research with the needs and interests of students to assess a number of theories which relate literature to wellbeing. It also encourages students to reflect on their own experiences as students, readers and critics of literature. Students with an interest in arts therapy may find the class a useful part of their degree, as well students considering teaching English or working in libraries, arts organisations or social care.The class will also provide a new avenue for literary investigation for students who may be considering going on to do interdisciplinary research. The learning outcomes will differ from learning objectives insofar as they focus on broader cognitive abilities, non-subject specific skills or graduate attributes.improved ability to understand what a theory is and how it can be evaluatedenhancement of skills taught in other English classes, such as textual analysis, argumentation, group discussion etc
Writing War, This class explores the literature of conflict in the 20th and 21st centuries, from the First World War to the Iraq War. The class treats war as a complex cultural phenomenon rather than a simple military activity, and as such we explore not only the literature of combat but also a range of texts.
Writing Short Fiction & Poetry, This core class will introduce creative writing students to two key genres: short fiction and poetry. Taught in workshop sessions by practising creative writers this will be a practice led class. On it, students will develop good practice related to the professional presentation of creative work, and will be introduced to the skills involved in reflecting critically on creative products and processes.The class will build on the basic writing techniques that students have developed in their first and second year of study such as: point of view, characterisation, setting, dialogue and narrative structure. The class will also encourage and expect a more advanced and discerning set of reading skills. Looking at a wide range of material such as novels, short stories and poems the class will examine a range of different narrative strategies, contexts and approaches and use these as stimuli for creative work.
Dramatic Writing, This class will be based around a selection of screen and radio scripts that have formed the basis for dramatic works such as: The Graduate, Mad Men, Bladerunner, The True Story of Bonnie Parker and When Harry Met Sally and will introduce key concepts in the theory and practice of creative writing as these emerge in the context of writing for radio and screen.Students will write dramatic scripts that demonstrate a good awareness of skills and techniques relevant to the genre, develop good practice related to the professional presentation of creative work, and be introduced to the skills involved in reflecting critically on creative products and processes. The class will be taught by practising creative writers.
Creative Economies & Culture Industry, This Honours option will explore how 'creative economies' operate in the twenty-first century, using a focus on local industries to investigate global issues and challenges. It will enable students to understand how the concepts of 'creative economy', 'cultural industry' or 'creative industries' developed, and explore the controversies which have often surrounded these terms.
Literature, Mind & Brain, This class responds to developments in literary research which are drawing on findings in cognitive science. A number of PhDs and postdoctoral researchers, as well as more experienced literary scholars, are using these findings to ask questions about the nature of literary experience in general, and the nature of specific literary texts in particular. In addition, the class responds to the increasing demand for interdisciplinary skills for humanities students. This is likely to appeal to honours English students who wish to bridge the gap between the critical analysis of texts and the rapidly changing model of human cognition emerging from psychology, neuroscience and philosophy.The class will combine a weekly reading of a scientific or philosophical article with a short literary text and consider the implications of and/or problems with the article in the light of the literary text. No class of this kind is currently on offer at Strathclyde.This class will consider verbal art as a special kind of language use; I use the term 'verbal art' because it includes oral as well as written and printed texts, though I have used 'literature' in the class title as it is more familiar to most students.The experience of verbal art is different from other kinds of language use because it invites minimal or no spoken contributions from hearers and because the focus of the event is not on the communication of information, among other things.The class will take recent findings from cognitive science about the experience of language, and use them to characterise the experience of verbal art and find out what makes it different from other kinds of experience. We will also experiment with the use of findings in cognitive science to analyse specific literary texts.
The 1930s: Literature & Culture, The 1930s is a period of cultural and political instability that is dominated by the inequalities between rich and poor, by problems with employment and housing, and by an insecure international situation in which the United Kingdom is increasingly isolated from developments in continental Europe. Into this conflict come authoritarian populist politicians intent on restoring strong leadership and the restoration of past national glories, and on the other side coalitions of the liberal left seeking a new politics to resist such authoritarian thinking. It is a period, in other words, strikingly like our own.In taking the class you will gain an understanding of the distinctive concerns of the literature and wider culture of the 1930s. We will pay particular attention to formal questions that dominate the decade’s literature - those of documentary, realism, and the legacy of Modernism - as well as to thematic issues of class division and national identity, urbanisation, and domestic politics.  You will also gain an understanding of the relationship between literature and other forms of cultural production in the period, particularly journalism and documentary cinema.By taking part in the class you will develop your abilities in close critical reading of literary texts and will gain further experience of independent learning and essay and examination writing.
Sixties Britain: Literature, Culture, Counterculture, The 1960s are often thought of as the decade of hedonism, hippies, free love and The Beatles. Yet the sixties were also a time of deep political unrest and activism, during which political movements for civil rights, anti-war and women’s liberation gained momentum. In addition, the 1960s were a decade of important technological advancements (including the introduction of colour television and developments in space exploration) which would have a fundamental effect on culture in Britain and beyond. This aim of this class, therefore, is to explore the legacy of the 1960s, its representation through a variety of key literary, cultural and critical texts.Beginning with an examination of British culture through a literary lens in the late 1950s, it goes on to explore the central tensions of the decade. In doing so, students will engage with a variety of classic texts of the period, examining the 1960s in terms of culture vs counterculture, class, race and gender, reflecting on just how controversial the decade actually was.
Songs: music & literature, This class looks at songs of different kinds. We ask what makes songs both similar to, and different from, poems. We explore how words are fitted to musical structures, including rhythms and tunes. We examine how poems are set to music, or otherwise accompanied by music; we consider the difference between poetic and musical metre, and the use of rhyme. We explore different kinds of singing style.  We examine why songs give us strong emotional experiences.We consider the difference between high and low cultures in songs, and the borrowing of songs between genres. We consider the role of songs in constructing identity, including national identity. We consider popular and rock songs, folk songs, and classical songs; in addition we will look at some overseas song traditions (eg Chinese, Australian Aboriginal).One of the assessments is an essay involving analysis of a song which you choose yourself; the other is an essay on the more general issues which arise.Students are not expected to have any prior knowledge of music or linguistics, or musical ability.
Soviet Literature: 1917-1967, This class looks at three key moments in the history of the Soviet Union, and explores how political contexts radically different from those in western Europe affected the way literature was written and interpreted.All texts are in English, translated from Russian. The Russian Revolution in 1917 happened at a moment of intense experimentation in literature across Europe. In the early revolutionary years, many Soviet writers of the avant garde explored the possibility of experimental writing which could both reach the masses and help to bring about social change. We will look at both the literary theory and some of the experimental texts from this period, including a film. In the 1930s, during Stalin's rule, this revolutionary approach was sidelined by a top down emphasis on 'Soviet socialist realism', fiction that is easily accessible and offers a vision of a brighter future for a population living through unprecedented change. We will look at three of these Socialist Realist novels and appraise how far they conformed with the ambitions of the state, as well as considering the nature of literary realism itself.Finally, we will consider literature by dissidents, writers who increasingly challenged the Communist regime in the 'Thaw' that followed Stalin's death in 1953, looking at novels by two dissident writers, including Boris Pasternak's Dr Zhivago.
Victorian Gothic, This class will examine the development of the Gothic tradition in a diverse selection of Victorian texts which will include works by the Brontes, Bram Stoker, H. G. Wells, Oscar Wilde and Arthur Conan Doyle.The aims of the course are twofold. Firstly, we will consider the literary origins and devices of Gothic in the popular novels and short stories of the Romantic period (eg Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein), and trace the ways in which major Victorian authors modified them, paying attention to questions such as genre and inter-textuality. However, these textual studies will continually be placed within a broader historical and social context: the principal aim of the class is to assess how an understanding of the fascination of the Gothic mode for Victorian authors can be used as a tool for exploring the complexities of nineteenth-century society.We will use the texts to consider issues such as urbanisation, scientific progress, religious crisis, Empire, new forms of communications technology and print culture, the ‘New Woman’, deviant sexualities, degeneration, decadence and the fin-de-siècle.Throughout, the texts will be read ‘against the grain’ by employing a range of critical terminology (such as Freud’s work on dreams or recent work on ‘female Gothic’).
Wild in the Renaissance, The concept of 'the wild' is one that emerges in many different ways in the writings of the Renaissance; in relation to self-cultivation (holding back the wildness within), the control of one's world (taming the ever-present wilderness); and in relations with fellow humans in a changing world (in savage domination). These ideas get played out in numerous ways in the period - from poetic use of the symbolic resonance of gardens and gardening; the religious underpinnings of the 'missionary endeavour' in the New World and what that says about the concept of human nature; to the anxious self-examination of humanity's inevitable sinfulness.This class will thus introduce you to key canonical texts from the period – plays, poetry, and court masques – by writers including Shakespeare, Jonson, and Milton, and will also engage with a critical and theoretical debates about the relationships between humans and the natural world from the new fields of animal studies and ecocriticism.
Social Research Methods, This class prepares you for designing and completing a research project. It will equip you with the skills and knowledge required in planning and delivering a research project.
The Glasgow Novel, This class will trace the development of fictional representations of Glasgow from the beginnings of industrialism to the present age. In doing so, it will consider a wide variety of historical and literary approaches to depicting the city. Beginning with a brief history of the pre-C20th Glasgow novel, the course goes on to consider some of the most famous literary depictions of Glasgow, including McArthur and Long’s No Mean City, Archie Hind’s The Dear Green Place and Alasdair Gray’s Lanark.
New Narratives, The publishing world is changing rapidly with the advent of digital publishing and the ebook. This class will enable students to explore new possibilities and write for new markets and platforms. It will also look at skills that students need for a career in both traditional and digital publication such as editing, submitting work and performing/reading work in front of an audience.This class aims to hone the skills students have acquired in previous years to produce new work for print, performance and for a range of digital platforms. It will also provide an up-to-date examination of the publishing world and will include reflective element.
The Power of Underlying Material: Adaptation, book to film & beyond, This class is an elective option in fourth year English that encourages students to look at the layering process involved in adapting a piece of underlying material either for literature or for the screen. We will examine a comprehensive range of source texts that inform many literary works and much of the screen drama available in the late 20th century and, in particular, in the current marketplace.The class will complement the third year core class in Creative Writing, and will also be useful to those undertaking honours dissertations in Creative Writing. As well as exercises in close reading, and theoretical analysis, the class will emphasise the commercial realities of basing work on underlying material.
Contemporary Travel Writing, This class engages with some of the key tensions in contemporary travel writing from race and sexuality, to issues of cultural stereotyping and ‘foreignness’. By working through a series of international case studies ranging from India to North America, the class will address why travel continues to be an important metaphor for thinking about our experience of the world, as well as offering a framework for how we understand it.This is a research-led module which explores issues of fiction and non-fiction writing. The educational aim is to introduce students to a range of contemporary travel writing and understand the basic conventions of the genre.
Forms of Feminism in Contemporary Literature, The class will explore how feminist concerns are represented in contemporary literature, and how literary forms shape contemporary feminism. Students will encounter some of the most important literary works of the post-1990 period, and learn to make connections between literary analysis and feminist theory. Engaging with a diverse range of literary forms—from novels, poems and plays to comics and manifestos—students will leave the course with an advanced understanding of the role literature plays in contemporary feminist politics.

Placement and Curriculum, On this module, students from across disciplines work together to learn about children and the communities in which they live; children's health and wellbeing; child protection; children's voice; children's play and play places. The notion that the health and wellbeing of children and young people is central to the advancement of society is a seminal theme in this module. The placement experience has been designed to allow students to undertake a work placement with children and young people from 0 - 14 years.  Placements will be provided in a range of settings outwith the mainstream classroom.This module allows students to spend 70 hours working with children and young people in a setting of the student’s choice.  Lectures and tutorials support students to develop the skills required to participate fully in the organisation with which they choose to work and allow students to explore issues that impact on the lives of children and young people.
Scotland: Renaissance and Reformation, This course will focus on the period from the final establishment of the territorial boundaries of the Scottish kingdom in James III’s reign through to the Union of Crowns in 1603. In covering the era of the Renaissance and Reformation in Scotland, as well as the regnal union of 1603, it will focus on the reigns of successive Stewart monarchs and their subsequent accession to the English and Irish thrones, thereby creating a British imperial monarchy.Scotland’s contact with Europe and its strained relations with England form core themes but political history will be studied in the light of the social, religious, economic and cultural developments that lend early-modern Scotland its distinct identity, thereby examining issues such as trade and economic development, the impact of the Renaissance in Scotland, literacy and the spread of reforming ideas, the arts, education and issues of identity.
Disease & Society, This class provides a broad introduction to the historical relationship between diseases and human societies in the early modern and modern periods.It examines the core thesis that diseases and other health conditions have had dramatic impacts on history, shaping economic relations, political and social structures and cultural and religious beliefs.  However, it also explores the reverse of this, the thesis that human activities, ideas and behaviours have radically altered the diseases and conditions that afflict our societies over the last five hundred years.The course is grouped around three themes:infectious diseasechronic diseasesociety's responses to diseaseLectures in the first two sections focus on exploring the origins of key diseases/debilities, the ways in which social structures/behaviours have caused or abetted these conditions, and their impacts on society, economics, politics and culture.In the final section, lectures focus more on the ways in which societies have sought to conceptualise, control and cure diseases. The key questions that students should be able to answer by the end is how have diseases and debilities shaped human societies, and how have human societies shaped diseases and debilities?

Oral History: Theory and Practice, Please note that this is compulsory for students who wish to use oral history in their dissertation.Oral history is a way of engaging with the past via the experiences and memories of those who were there. ‘Oral history’ is a multifaceted term that refers to the sources (interviews), the methodology (interviewing), theory (analysis), and products (of which there are many).This new class aims to alert students to the possibilities of using oral history as a way of understanding the past. It will examine key concepts and methodologies in oral history and explore how oral history has helped to shape historical understanding.This class also has an important practice-based focus – students taking the class will gain an opportunity to develop practical skills in oral history interviewing and analysis as well as to reflect critically on theory in relation to practice. They will also get an opportunity to explore the application and use of history in the public arena through engaging with work on oral history and public history.Because of the practical nature of this class and the limited supply of equipment, numbers are capped at 25.
Cold War Europe, 
Disability in Modern Britain, The aim of this class is for to gain an understanding of the key role that disability plays in the study of the historical past.The class will explore the ways in which disability has been defined, treated and experienced. It will place developments in disability policy within wider social, cultural and political contexts. Students will engage with, and think critically about, primary sources ranging from official papers, newspaper articles, and oral testimonies, in addition to relevant secondary source material.The use of oral testimonies in particular will help students to consider the lived experiences of disabled people and the ways in which society sought to define and treat disability. 
Medicine & Warfare, This class explores the role that health and medicine has played in the major wars of the twentieth century. In particular, it considers the vital contribution that medicine has made to manpower economy, discipline and morale.Focusing predominantly on Britain, the USA and Europe, the class analyses the ways that different countries have responded to the medical issues posed by modern warfare in both military and civilian contexts. As such, it considers issues such as wartime disability, welfare provision, occupational health and psychiatry, and explores the role that military doctors, women and humanitarian organisations have played in shaping medical responses to war.The key objective of this class is to place military-medical developments within their wider social, cultural and political contexts and to examine the impact of military health and medicine on the lived experience of war.
France at War, The class begins with the traumatic episodes of the Franco-Prussian War and the Communes of 1871. By analysing the often problematic political and cultural consolidation of the Third Republic, this class will explore the ‘culture wars’ and the internal divisions that culminated in the Dreyfus Affair. After the humiliation of losing its status as Europe’s dominant power, France sought greatness in colonial expansion in Africa and Indochina, while seeking to consolidate national identity by transforming ‘peasants into Frenchmen’.You'll explore the experiences of the First World War, assessing the strength of French unity in the face of the German enemy. The interwar clashes between fascism and the Popular Front will then be examined and how the First World War impacted upon French foreign policy and attitudes towards future war.You'll spend three weeks exploring the enduring controversies of the Second World War, focusing upon the collapse, resistance, collaboration, and French involvement in the persecution of the Jews, as France faced its ‘hereditary enemy’ once again.The class concludes with an analysis of the French withdrawal from Indochina and Algeria and an assessment of France’s position in the post-war global order.A variety of sources will be explored throughout the class, including paintings, monuments, films, literary sources, newspaper reports, memoirs and archival documents.

Society and Politics in Colonial India: 1880s-1947, This class will cover the political developments and social groups from the late-nineteenth century till the decolonisation of South Asia in 1947.This is a key period in the social and political history of modern South Asia as it witnessed the growth of a mass-based anti-colonial struggle.  Simultaneously, the involvement of different social groups in this process led to the emergence of community and caste based identity politics.  Under pressure from demands for independence, the colonial state initiated a process of phased devolution of power, and decolonisation after the Second World War.  The class will compare these developments to raise questions about the 'modernity' of colonial society and polity.  The class will analyse how different social groups - such as the peasantry, the working class and tribal groups - participated in and shaped political movements in South Asia.Students will also be encouraged to use the regional perspective of South Asian history to understand the different expressions of class, gender and ethnicity in non-Western societies.
Scotland’s Highland Problem, Historiography had tended to isolate Highland history from Scottish political development during the late medieval and early modern periods.  This class will re-address this trend, emphasising the Highlands as an integral part of Scottish society, at the same time exploring the division within Scotland between the ‘barbaric’ Highlands and the ‘civil’ Lowlands.Students will study the nature and structure of clan society and place Highland events within the wider context of national and British politics during the sixteenth century.  While relations between the Scottish crown and its Highland subjects is the key theme of this class, students will analyse the extent to which such relations changed through time, and why.The class will also highlight divergent policies within clan society itself, a factor which warns against treating the Highlands as a homogenous whole, instead taking into consideration regional, local and personal biases.  
Scottish Society since 1914, The class provides a broad survey of Scottish social history since 1914. The aim of this class is to explore the nature and development of Scottish society in the twentieth century by assessing the impact of industrialisation and the problems associated with de-industrialisation, as well as the development of an urban society.By the end, the successful student should have expanded their knowledge of contemporary Scottish history and have a good idea of the diversity of issues, techniques and arguments which historians have deployed in the study of twentieth-century Scotland. Among the themes to be covered are:the extent to which Scotland had a recognisable culture and identitythe myths and realities of 'Red Clydeside'the notion that Scotland was a more intensely patriarchal society than the rest of Britainthe idea that Scotland was an anti-immigrant, racist and religiously intolerant society
History and Philosophy of Education, This module will support students in developing their knowledge and understanding of the roots of some key educational ideas in history. These will be considered from a philosophical perspective.
The Scramble for the Middle East: Arab Nationalism, Zionism and European Colonial Powers, 1914-1939, The interwar years are central to any analysis of the decline of European colonial rule in the Middle East and the formation of nation states. It was in the 1920s and 1930s that British and French mandatory authorities faced the emergence of nationalist movements throughout the Arab world as well as the increasing competition and penetration of hostile forces.Students will examine historical themes and events that are significant to the development of political and cultural identities in the Middle East. Through the analysis of primary sources, students will focus on:the debate surrounding British and French colonial practicesthe emergence of the Zionist movement and the creation of a Jewish home in Palestinethe radicalisation of Arab nationalism and its impact upon the relations between local political elites and European colonial powersthe increasing tension between Jewish and Arab communities in Palestinethe creation of the mandates in Palestine, Transjordan, Syria and Lebanon and the process that led to the independence of Egypt and Iraqthe challenge brought by German and Italian subversive activities to British and French strategic interests in the region
Twentieth-Century Czechoslovakia, The class will explore major themes in twentieth-century European history:the post-World War I settlementthe rise of fascismthe origins and course of the Second World War, Soviet expansion, the Cold War, the social and political revolutions of the 1960s and the waning of the Soviet Union in the 1980s and 1990s -- from the perspective of a central European country which was created in 1918, dissolved in 1993, and whose opinions were seldom taken into account by the Great Powers.Students will obtain a solid grounding in the history of Czechoslovakia from its creation to its dissolution.

Rwanda: Peace, Conflict & the Politics, The purpose of this special subject is to introduce students to the study of peace and conflict, broadly defined, and to encourage them to write and think about these subjects in a critical and engaged manner informed first and foremost by history-based discourse, but also borrowing from political science, anthropology, and related disciplines.The module will focus on the case study of Rwanda, with individual classes proceeding chronologically.The first semester will cover the pre-colonial period to the start of the second Hutu Republic in 1973, while the second semester will cover 1973 to present.Throughout, students will analyse relevant primary and secondary sources to explore the benefits of applying a historical lens to understanding a nation whose recent history includes both periods of peace and political stability, and several manifestations of state-sanctioned violence, including colonialism, small-scale ethnic, regional, and political conflicts, civil war, genocide, and authoritarianism.Students seeking careers in human rights advocacy, international law, diplomacy, and journalism will also find this course particularly relevant.
Plantation in Ulster, This class will explore the plantations that took place in Ulster during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.Students will examine the emergence of the idea for plantation in Ireland, why Ulster was regarded as suitable for plantation, and the various endeavours by English and Scots to settle in the north of Ireland, whether by private enterprise or by the state. This will culminate in the official Plantation of Ulster, a 'British' project initiated by James VI and I in the early years of his reign as king of England, Ireland and Scotland.Students will also look at a couple of cases studies of individuals who were involved in plantation, enabling a detailed study of the political, social, economic and confessional reasons why they chose to migrate to and settle in Ireland at this time.
France at War, 1870-1962, The class begins with the traumatic episodes of the Franco-Prussian War and the Communes of 1871. By analysing the often problematic political and cultural consolidation of the Third Republic, this class will explore the ‘culture wars’ and the internal divisions that culminated in the Dreyfus Affair. After the humiliation of losing its status as Europe’s dominant power, France sought greatness in colonial expansion in Africa and Indochina, while seeking to consolidate national identity by transforming ‘peasants into Frenchmen’.You'll explore the experiences of the First World War, assessing the strength of French unity in the face of the German enemy. The interwar clashes between fascism and the Popular Front will then be examined and how the First World War impacted upon French foreign policy and attitudes towards future war.You'll spend three weeks exploring the enduring controversies of the Second World War, focusing upon the collapse, resistance, collaboration, and French involvement in the persecution of the Jews, as France faced its ‘hereditary enemy’ once again.The class concludes with an analysis of the French withdrawal from Indochina and Algeria and an assessment of France’s position in the post-war global order.A variety of sources will be explored throughout the class, including paintings, monuments, films, literary sources, newspaper reports, memoirs and archival documents.
Medicine & Warfare in the Twentieth Century, This class explores the role that health and medicine has played in the major wars of the twentieth century. In particular, it considers the vital contribution that medicine has made to manpower economy, discipline and morale.Focusing predominantly on Britain, the USA and Europe, the class analyses the ways that different countries have responded to the medical issues posed by modern warfare in both military and civilian contexts. As such, it considers issues such as wartime disability, welfare provision, occupational health and psychiatry, and explores the role that military doctors, women and humanitarian organisations have played in shaping medical responses to war.The key objective of this class is to place military-medical developments within their wider social, cultural and political contexts and to examine the impact of military health and medicine on the lived experience of war.
Scottish Society, The class provides a broad survey of Scottish social history since 1914.The aim of this class is to explore the nature and development of Scottish society (and place it in a wider context) and to examine dominant narratives of Scotland and Scots in the twentieth century.By the end, the successful student should have expanded their knowledge of contemporary Scottish history and have a good idea of the diversity of issues, methodologies and arguments which historians have deployed in the study of twentieth-century Scotland.  Among the themes to be covered are:gender relations (for example, analysis of the Scottish ‘hard man’ narrative)religion (including sectarianism and secularisation)health and deprivationthe arts and culture (including festivals, theatre, cinema and television)industry (and de-industrialisation and its impacts)Overall, this class will explore the extent to which Scotland had a recognisable national culture and identity and assess and deconstruct narratives of Scottish society since 1914.    
Society & Politics in Colonial India, This class will cover the political developments and social groups from the late-nineteenth century till the decolonisation of South Asia in 1947.This is a key period in the social and political history of modern South Asia as it witnessed the growth of a mass-based anti-colonial struggle.  Simultaneously, the involvement of different social groups in this process led to the emergence of community and caste based identity politics.  Under pressure from demands for independence, the colonial state initiated a process of phased devolution of power, and decolonisation after the Second World War.  The class will compare these developments to raise questions about the 'modernity' of colonial society and polity.  The class will analyse how different social groups - such as the peasantry, the working class and tribal groups - participated in and shaped political movements in South Asia.Students will also be encouraged to use the regional perspective of South Asian history to understand the different expressions of class, gender and ethnicity in non-Western societies.
Policy and Politics in Education, This class will provide students with the opportunity to engage in debate about current issues in education through detailed exploration of the policy and political contexts. It will introduce students to frameworks for understanding how policy comes about and how it is inextricably linked with political issues.

Dissertation/Special Project (Semester 1 or 2), Students can choose to do an individual project on a topic related to journalism, media or communication, which involves original academic or journalistic research under one-on-one supervision with staff. An academic dissertation involves individual scholarly research on a chosen topic. The special project is an extension of feature writing skills and will take those to a new level by requiring students to produce a much longer and more sophisticated portfolio of work.

Legal Methods, The aims of this class are to:provide students with a basic knowledge of the history, structure and institutions of the Scottish legal systemprovide students with the skills required to find, interpret and analyse the law applicable in Scotland, from all their various sourcesintroduce students to competing conceptions of lawintroduce students to legal reasoning
Public Law 1, Following on from the introduction to the constitution – its key actors, institutions and their functions – in Public Law 1, students taking Public Law 2 will build upon that knowledge here: first by focusing on the ways in which legal (judicial review) and quasi-legal (tribunals, public inquiries, ombudsmen) bodies supervise the exercise of constitutional and administrative decision making; secondly, by a detailed analysis of the political and legal mechanisms which exist for the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. As such, Public Law 2 is concerned with the abuse of power, and the ways and means by which power can be limited and held to account – whether that is the power of a golf club to suspend an unruly member, the power of a local authority to order the compulsory purchase of privately owned property, or the power of the Prime Minister to wage war.
Public Law 2, Following on from Public Law 1, Public Law 2 aims to consolidate knowledge and understanding of constitutional and administrative law. Students taking this class will require to have taken Public Law 1 in the first year. It'll build upon knowledge of the key concepts and institutions of the UK constitution. As a second year class, its rationale is to give students the opportunity to progress from an understanding of the constitution to an understanding of the role of the law in the constitutional control of public power. This course encourages students to adopt an evaluative and critical stance towards ongoing constitutional developments. The course will focus on control of administrative action, both by the judiciary and by ombudsmen. The protection of individual rights will be a key feature, focusing on judicial protection but also encompassing the role of human rights institutions in the UK and Scotland. The future control of public power will be discussed, including topical debates concerning constitutional reform in this area.
Domestic Relations, Family law concerns the control which the law exerts over domestic relationships and families; it affects everyone to a greater or lesser degree.Topics include:the legal status of children, parental responsibilities and rights and the upbringing of children - including issues in adoption and fostering, local authority care and the Children's Hearing systemlegal consequences of marriage/civil partnershipdivorce - including what happens to the family and its financial consequencesunmarried domestic relations, opposite-sex and same-sex
Commercial Law, Commercial law is a second year compulsory subject on the LLB (and LML) degree. The class provides students with an understanding of commercial law in a Scottish context. It partially meets the commercial law subject requirements and related skills outcomes of the Law Society of Scotland and the Faculty of Advocates (albeit that some of the commercial professional topics, eg sale of goods and insurance law, are dealt with by other courses).Building on the knowledge acquired by students in first year, the general academic objective of the course is to examine the basic principles and rules concerning core aspects of commercial law, including the main principles of agency, partnership and company law, the law relating to various methods of payment (including consumer credit and bills of exchange) the rules governing the ways in which creditors can ‘secure’ repayment of a debt (eg through taking personal guarantees from third parties for repayment of the debt, or by establishing rights in security over debtor property); the basic principles of diligence; the consequences of both corporate and individual debtor inability to repay debts (corporate insolvency and personal bankruptcy respectively).While the focus of the class is on ‘a black letter’ analysis of relevant statutory and common law in the broad commercial area, in order to aid understanding of relevant principles, the class also examines the policy rationales underlying the current law and recent and projected reforms in this area.This class examines the basic principles and rules concerning core aspects of commercial law.

Politics 1A: Concepts & Processes, This class provides an introduction to the study of politics from a scientific perspective. The course covers how modern states around the world function and interact through from a social science perspective. The course will cover the basic concepts that characterise the essence of political life within and across countries and use these concepts to explore arguments and theories on the functioning of human behaviour. We'll cover key concepts, ranging from the meaning of democracy and authoritarianism, to structures and institutions – including elections and governments – essential to understanding modern politics.You'll leave the class with the basic tools, concepts and approaches to interpret the political events as a political scientist and the background information to succeed in your journey through political science topics at the University of Strathclyde.
Politics 1B: Decision making & Outcomes, This class investigates the role of actors and political institutions in policymaking processes within states and across political regimes. The class builds on Politics 1A in which the main focus was on concepts and key institutions. This previous knowledge is used to develop a deeper understanding of political actors’ behaviour and the processes through which they influence outcomes. It covers a range of political processes that take place within democratic and non-democratic states and beyond. The class examines a range of outcomes that influence the lives of citizens, including the policies associated with modern welfare states.You'll leave the class with the ability to read and critically discuss research in political science and the broader social sciences. This class will equip you to evaluate academic findings and debates in the field of comparative politics, to interpret the political events as a political scientist and to build foundational knowledge for undertaking research in political science topics.
International Relations & Global Politics, The objective of this class is to introduce you to the academic study of International Relations (IR). The class begins by examining the basic concepts and historical contexts in order to give you a firm grounding in IR. The next part of the course delves into the major theories of IR, which will provide you with conceptual underpinnings into world affairs.

Parliamentary Studies, This class is co-taught with staff from the UK Parliament and the Scottish Parliament. It also involves deliberative sessions with parliamentarians.
Contemporary British Governance, The class focuses on how Britain is governed, focusing particularly on how its main institutions and processes – with their own influences, conflict and dynamics – have risen to the multiple challenges of the modern world, ranging from demands for sub-national autonomy in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to the opportunities and constraints afforded by Britain’s membership of the European Union.The class is organised around thematic issues of governance, containing with them, the core institutions processes, influences and debates on the British system of governance. It deals with:culture, context and constitutiongovernance at the centre (parliament, prime minister, cabinet, courts)dispersed governance at the sub-national and supra-national levels (local government, devolved bodies, agencies and quangos, and the EU)democracy and accountability in a complex system of governance (citizens, elections, parties, interest groups, public opinion and media)adapting and coping (coalition and latest developments).It will be taught via a combination of lectures (introducing students to key themes/debates and tutorials (allowing highly interactive and student-centred discussion of contemporary issues and cases).The class focuses on how Britain is governed, focusing particularly on how its main institutions and processes – with their own influences, conflict and dynamics – have risen to the multiple challenges of the modern world, ranging from demands for sub-national autonomy in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to the opportunities and constraints afforded by Britain’s membership of the European Union.The class focuses on how Britain is governed, focusing particularly on how its main institutions and processes – with their own influences, conflict and dynamics – have risen to the multiple challenges of the modern world, ranging from demands for sub-national autonomy in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to the opportunities and constraints afforded by Britain’s membership of the European Union.The class focuses on how Britain is governed, focusing particularly on how its main institutions and processes – with their own influences, conflict and dynamics – have risen to the multiple challenges of the modern world, ranging from demands for sub-national autonomy in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to the opportunities and constraints afforded by Britain’s membership of the European Union.The class focuses on how Britain is governed, focusing particularly on how its main institutions and processes – with their own influences, conflict and dynamics – have risen to the multiple challenges of the modern world, ranging from demands for sub-national autonomy in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to the opportunities and constraints afforded by Britain’s membership of the European Union.The class focuses on how Britain is governed, focusing particularly on how its main institutions and processes – with their own influences, conflict and dynamics – have risen to the multiple challenges of the modern world, ranging from demands for sub-national autonomy in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to the opportunities and constraints afforded by Britain’s membership of the European Union.The class focuses on how Britain is governed, focusing particularly on how its main institutions and processes – with their own influences, conflict and dynamics – have risen to the multiple challenges of the modern world, ranging from demands for sub-national autonomy in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to the opportunities and constraints afforded by Britain’s membership of the European Union.The class focuses on how Britain is governed, focusing particularly on how its main institutions and processes – with their own influences, conflict and dynamics – have risen to the multiple challenges of the modern world, ranging from demands for sub-national autonomy in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to the opportunities and constraints afforded by Britain’s membership of the European Union.The class focuses on how Britain is governed, focusing particularly on how its main institutions and processes – with their own influences, conflict and dynamics – have risen to the multiple challenges of the modern world, ranging from demands for sub-national autonomy in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to the opportunities and constraints afforded by Britain’s membership of the European Union.
War, Terrorism & Conflict, This course looks at the multi-faceted and ever-changing nature of war, conflict and terrorism, in the context of the end of the Cold War and the September 11 terrorist attacks. It addresses debates within the sub-discipline of Strategic Studies (for example, the study of the use of force) and International Relations more broadly, relevant to the causes of war, the conditions of peace and strategies for dealing with terrorism and conflict.
Philosophy of Economic Policy, Economics is not only about the technical allocation of scarce resources among competing needs. Economy policy choices inevitably involve political trade-offs, social concerns and value judgments. In this light, this class looks at the ideational and ethical underpinnings of public policymaking. The focus is on how the clash of economic ideas shapes policy decisions in key areas. It also examines the sources and implications of big shifts in policy paradigms. An effort will be made to make sense of the direction of economics and the rethinking of policy frameworks in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.This course familiarizes you with the historical debates over alternative economic paradigms and policies and their historical and philosophical foundations. Questions such as why some nations are richer than others and what should governments do to overcome economic crises are as pressing today as they were a century ago. Indeed, the question “what is the best economic policy” has been asked and debated over centuries, and, as it turns out, policymakers are still guided by ideas and paradigms that were articulated by men and women centuries ago. At the end of this course, the you'll have a better knowledge about how our economic and financial world was developed.
Can Democracy Deliver?, This course is part of the university’s new initiative in Vertically Integrated Projects for Sustainable Development (VIP4SD). VIPs are designed to provide students from second-year through to postgraduate with an opportunity to work with teams of other students on projects related to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. Undergraduate students may participate in a project for up to three years.In this VIP we'll examine the linkages between the quality of democratic governance, citizenship, service delivery, and quality of life in developing countries, with a focus on Africa. You'll have the opportunity to investigate important policy-relevant questions using various forms of survey, administrative, national accounts, and spatial data to track progress toward the sustainable development goals and investigate factors that facilitate or retard sustainable development. The complexity of the research project will differ according to the level of the student.Semester 1 and 2This course is part of the university’s new initiative in Vertically Integrated Projects for Sustainable Development (VIP4SD).

Theories & Practices of Regulation & Governance, The aim of this class is to introduce students to the concepts, theories, institutions and processes of regulatory governance. The transnational and international dimension of regulatory governance is also taken into account.
Political Parties, This class adopts a comparative approach to the study of political parties and party systems, focusing on Europe and the United States. We discuss the main functions and organisational and ideological characteristics of the different types of parties found in these regions, and the way in which parties adapt to social change.We look at the relationship between parties and voters from the alternative theoretical perspectives of class voting, partisan identification and rational choice. We also examine party systems and party government.
Comparative Politics, The class focuses on how we do comparative politics (methodology). We'll consider the comparative method, and how the scientific method can be applied to the study of politics. We consider the problem of only having a relatively small number of cases to compare, and how we select these, as well as the difference between case-study driven, small-n and large-n studies. We also consider the use of ideal types – the importance of finding a language to compare very complex systems.
Green Politics, This class is divided into four main blocks:green political theoryenvironmental attitudes & behaviourenvironmental movementsgreen parties
Political Behaviour, The focus of this class is the individual voter. Individual characteristics, such as education, socio-economic status, political attitudes and values, or involvement in social and political networks are looked at. However, contextual factors, such as the institutional framework, can also play a role for a wide range of political actions.
Feminism & Politics, This class provides a critical introduction to feminism and its implications for politics. Over the last few decades, feminists have systematically challenged the long-standing view that politics is gender-neutral by uncovering masculinist bias and drawing attention to the neglected experiences, values and arguments of women.Feminists have also reconstructed key political concepts and practices and expanded the range of issues and ideas understood to be political.
International Relations Theory in a Global Age, This class explores debates about key concepts in International Relations theory, in the context of what is widely seen as a new era in the analysis and practice of global politics.

The Welfare State in Comparative Perspective, This class examines the development of welfare states as a global phenomenon.  It asks what we mean by the concept of a ‘welfare state’ and looks at the ways in which welfare states have developed in different countries.  It also explores some of the major differences between different types of welfare state, using the concept of ‘welfare régimes’.
Workplace Learning & Practice 1, This module seeks to build upon students' practical knowledge and understanding gained at HNC level in a particular discipline and to extend their understanding of how practice is driven by the need to develop the concept of working collaboratively.  Auditing a range of services/settings will develop an insight and awareness of the complexities of professional practice in collaborative settings. Students will be introduced to the concept of analysing and evaluating material gathered from the audit.
The Societal Context of Professional Working, Students intending to work within community health, education or social services should familiarise themselves with the societal context in which they'll work. The ‘societal context’ refers to social factors that may influence the needs for services, and may also impact on their effective delivery. This awareness envelops the individual’s social responsibilities and the responsibilities of the professional groups involved in service provision.Students will explore the nature of the 'community,' how it develops and how it is defined. Students will also look at the professional codes that facilitate social interaction, reciprocity and cooperation. Social problems and the roles of professionals are also explored.This module shall lay the basis for issues that shall be developed further in Level 9: Context, Policy and Joint Working.
How People Develop & Learn, Professionals working with people need to understand the dynamics of human development and learning and the contexts that influence this. In order to enhance the quality of life for people who use Education and Social Services, professionals need to understand how people develop and learn. The aim of the module is to build on earlier study and enhance students' understanding of how learning and development is influenced by social, environmental, biological, cultural and personal factors.Students in higher education need to understand the processes of learning and development in order to enhance their skills and maximise their own capacity for lifelong learning.
Introduction to Integrated Services, The integration of services through joint planning and delivery of services across health, education, community education, social work and related services has been identified as a key mechanism for supporting families, facilitating learning, protecting children, promoting health and wellbeing and empowering communities socially and economically. There is growing recognition that practitioners need to be competent in working with others in disciplines other than their own. This is, in part, recognition of a history of service failure arising from ineffective collaboration across disciplines.Developing professionals in educational and social services are required to understand the knowledge, skills and values required to work collaboratively and the challenges to services themselves as they respond to the integrated services agenda.
Being Professional Working Collaboratively, This model provides a structured and supported introduction to quality frameworks and to how quality is evaluated. It is put into context by looking at students' placement experiences as well as exploring national contexts through consideration of policy, literature and e-learning sources.The module also helps the development of a critical, evidence-based and reflective approach to professional development and professional action.
Contexts Policy & Joint Working, Particular emphasis is placed on students' ability to appreciate the theory of effective inter-agency and collaborative practice, including issues of individual and community empowerment, accountability and leadership.Students will learn about the relationship of theory of community, family and human development to the development of social policy, with particular emphasis on effective inter-agency and collaborative practice and its implementation within students' practice placement.
Management & Leadership in Integrated Services, This module aims to develop students' knowledge and understanding of issues affecting the leadership and management of self and others, the change process, management of conflict and a consideration of the skills required to successfully lead and manage in a social services establishment. This module is aimed at all professionals whether or not they hold posts of responsibility.The module is mapped to the SSSC NOS for health and social service workers, the NHS Leadership Framework and the Standard for Childhood Practice.
Understanding How People Behave, Students builds on and use the learning they have gained from the first module of this strand, How People Develop and Learn. A central theme throughout the module is developing understanding and awareness of the operation of discrimination and disadvantage at personal, cultural and structural levels.Students will also develop their understanding of observation, assessment, recording, analysis and approaches to the management of behaviour as well as ways to support service users.
Workplace Learning & Practice 2, Students further develop the professional knowledge, values and skills relevant for integrated practice and for managing a specific development project.The placement will consolidate the student’s learning from across the course, particularly building on the key theories that have been introduced in the Management and Leadership in Integrated Services module. The module will have two phases: a project planning phase and a project implementation phase.In order to further develop professional competences students will also continue to engage in the range of activities undertaken in Workplace Learning and Practice 1.
Workplace Learning & Practice 3, This class provides an extended work-based learning experience, which will enable students to apply knowledge and theory to integrated services. It'll offer opportunities for students to consider how integrated services meet the needs of service users, and understand the role of evidence informed practice in the delivery of services.
Specialist Pathway, This class aims to provide students with an in-depth knowledge of contemporary practice issues in relation to specific service user groups. The class develops knowledge and skills in meeting the needs of people in a range of targeted services across the lifespan.
Personal & Professional Development, The aim of the class is to provide a formal and structured opportunity for consolidation of learning and planning for future learning and employment. Students will formally record and capture their learning and use this knowledge to gain relevant employment following graduation.This class has three main aims:encountering one another and learning to prize personal diversity of experiencedeveloping acceptance and resilience in the fact of difficult processes in self and otherslearning how to resolve interpersonal difficulties.
Professional Inquiry & Evidence Informed Practice - Dissertation, Students undertake a small-scale project for their honours dissertation in social work. It directly addresses the growing recognition that practitioners in Education and Social Care must be competent in reviewing using and conducting research.

It encourages a critical understanding of Spanish history and contextualises the work of several Spanish seminal thinkers (Unamuno, Ortega, Azaña and Zambrano) and it explores their thought in relation to the key themes of the course: ideas, beliefs, and identity.
Education & Learning, The overall purpose of this class is to develop student’s understanding of educational thought and language. Because this class is not organised around a given profession (e.g. teaching in schools) the discussion of education will be quite general and applies to any educational context, from parenting, to school, to college, to lifelong learning and informal education. ‘Education and Learning’ addresses questions that are at the heart of understanding what education is and what learning is. That these terms denote different things is an important starting point.
TESOL 1: An Introduction, This module introduces students to the fundamentals of language learning. Students will develop a basic understanding of current views on how languages are learned. Drawing on their own experience as language learner/users, this module will examine key theories and concepts in second language acquisition.
Digital Technologies in Language Education, This module explores the use of digital technologies for language teaching and learning. The aim is to give students an overview of the tools and activities used in the field of computer-assisted language learning (CALL). Students will also develop the practical experience of using digital technology, learn to design and evaluate digital materials for the language classroom, and create the digital environment for language learning. The module considers ways to develop students’ 21st Century skills both as language user/learners and as language teachers.
Culture, Society, Formation, The purpose of Culture, Society, Formation is to introduce students to a sample of foundational texts which have informed and transformed our understanding of culture and society and to consider the impact that these understandings have had and continue to have on education. Through a critical reading of excerpts from such historical and contemporary texts as The Prince, The Communist Manifesto, and Gender Trouble, the module will take what is foundational in cultural and sociological writing and explore it in the context of educational conditions.
Developing Language and Communication Skills, This module will equip students with the required knowledge of understanding the process of reading, writing, listening and speaking in a second/foreign language, especially in academic settings. The aim is to give students increased confidence in communicating in English. Students will extend their vocabulary, improve their pronunciation and grammatical accuracy, and develop their communicative competence.
Adult Education with Placement, The purpose of this module is twofold. First, it aims to offer an overview of key considerations (e.g. literacy, multilingualism, new technologies) in the development of educational activities for adult learners through a series of pre-placement seminars. Second, the students will have the opportunity to apply the new knowledge and skills learned during a one-week placement with an organisation that works with adult learners.
Children and Childhood, This class will explore how children and childhood have been imagined and constructed in a range of historical and contemporary contexts. Drawing on representations of children we aim to support you in developing an understanding of children and childhood as part of a set of social and cultural relations. With a focus on environments other than formal education, the module will seek to open for discussion the nature of childhood according to themes such as politics, history, play, work, the global and queerness.
TESOL 2: Methods, Approaches and Techniques in Language Teaching, This module introduces students to the pedagogical processes in language teaching. The topics include traditional and contemporary language teaching methods (audiolingual, communicative language teaching, task-based language learning, etc.). We will also discuss practical issues such as lesson planning, material evaluation and design, needs analysis and profiling, and classroom management. In this module, students will gain some first-hand experience of English language teaching in practice through micro-teaching.
Designing Educational Research, This team-taught module will introduce students to the theory and practice of educational research. This includes lectures on the principles of research design and seminars in which students will collaborate in small group projects, familiarising themselves with qualitative and quantitative methods and their uses for interdisciplinary education studies research. The module will be assessed through a short essay and a research proposal, in preparation for dissertation planning.
Language Awareness: Knowledge about Language, This module aims to provide students with an introduction to ways in which the English language can be described and analysed in order to help learners to develop their knowledge about language. The module deepens students’ understanding of core features of the English language and prepares them to apply their knowledge about language systems (pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar and discourse) in teaching practice.
Critical Issues in Education, Education is not uncontested. Its place within society and the fact that nearly all have experience of education and related institutions means that a plethora of ideas and ideologies of education abound. This module discusses some of the ways in which educational moments are constructed through politics, society, culture and religion. It encourages students to delve deeply into the various forms theories and ideologies take: their formation and maintenance; and then deconstructs these. It locates education as a societal right rather than a personal endeavour so that internationally, nationally and locally agreed and contested matters take centre stage.
TESOL 3: Current Issues in Language Education, This module offers a critical examination of a range of contemporary issues in language education. Students will learn about key pedagogical issues and debates from the latest language education research. The aim is to challenge students’ existing beliefs and values in more specialised and advanced areas. Topics to be covered include individual learner differences from a sociocultural perspective, learner identity, language teaching methodologies in the changing local and global contexts, bilingualism and multilingualism, immersion and translanguaging.
Research Methods for TESOL, This module provides an introduction to research skills, research design and research methods in TESOL. It familiarises students with the research process in language education, focusing on developing students’ knowledge, skills and understanding before carrying out a small-scale research project in language education.
Educational Representations in Film and Literature, Educational Representations in Film and Literature provides students with opportunities to reflect on educational questions through popular literary and visual media. The opportunity to interpret and reflect upon education in the context of popular culture allows students to examine theories in practice, albeit fictional contexts of practice. As well as the representations of education, the literature regularly embodies the pedagogical intentions of the author, intentions which will be explored in the module. These and other considerations form the structure and content of this module.
Placement Learning: Secondary School, Students will undertake a placement in a secondary school working with children learning English as a foreign language. This module will focus on professional identity, teacher agency and will give students the opportunity to reflect on the translation and transformation of their learning as they return to teach in their home country.

Communism in Practice: the Case of Czechoslovakia, Czechoslovakia, the last post-war European country to fall behind the Iron Curtain, was exceptional in allying itself to the Soviet Union voluntarily and in bringing its own Communists to power more or less democratically. Confident at first that it would be able to pursue its own path to socialism, the Czechoslovak Communist Party soon became one of the most rigidly Stalinist of all the Soviet satellites. The same Party which, in the 1950s, held some of the most notorious show-trials and put up the largest statue of Stalin to be found anywhere in the world, became, in the 1960s, the author of 'Socialism with a Human Face', a package of attempted economic and political reforms explosive enough to end in the country’s invasion by most of its Warsaw Pact allies.This class will seek to move beyond the stereotypes and oversimplifications of Communism passed down by Cold War rhetoric to explore the shifting nature of Communist thought, power politics and international relations in this most perplexing of times in the history of Central Europe.

Contemporary Issues in International Financial Reporting, This class will discuss selected topics in the preparation of financial statements for external publication. The subjects selected will be issues that provide an opportunity to explore various parts of the regulation of financial reporting and the associated accounting choices implied by such regulations. The class will include a significant coverage of contemporary issues which have been of interest both to the accountancy profession and to society in recent years. This is an advanced level class in financial accounting. It discusses complex issues at both a practical and a theoretical level. By the time that students complete this class they should have an appreciation of both the difficulties faced by preparers, auditors and standard setters in ensuring that a set of accounts gives a true and fair view and also an awareness of the extent to which academic research can guide and illuminate this process. 
Management Accounting: Theory & Practice, 
Accounting & Risk, Risk and risk management is the basis of many accounting techniques. Financial reporting was introduced to protect investors from the actions of bad or incompetent managers. Financial auditing was introduced to further enhance this risk management tool. Many business decisions are about balancing risks – for example decisions to insure or not to insure, what level of investment in safety equipment, to hedge against currency or interest rate movements. Accounting can be viewed as a desire to reduce risks.Over the past few years new theories of risk have been emerging that question our understanding of risk and the way in which risk is factored into organisational and individual decision-making. These new theories question the applicability of objective risk and probability theories used in finance and accounting. The consequences of these theories have the potential to radically alter many accounting conventions and basic techniques. This class explores these potential consequences. This class will explore the emerging risk debate by introducing the students to a new literature base and consider the impact on accounting from this new risk perspective. Existing techniques will be deconstructed using risk theories and new ways of accounting for risk explored. Students will develop an enhanced risk framework offering new insights into existing problems and phenomena.
Auditing Theory & Practice, This class will discuss the nature and purpose of the external audit of financial statements through an examination of the formal institutional framework (the work of the International Federation of Accountants), the informal framework (the Big Four audit firms) and the processes underlying the collection of audit evidence and reporting of results.It'll adopt the perspective of the institutions and participants in the audit process themselves. This will require an agency-based approach to the discipline. While the limitations of this approach will be addressed in the passing, it's intended that students will see this class as a counterpoint to the more rigorous and theoretically motivated classes that are presently offered in the honours programme.
Accounting Ethics, This class will discuss the nature of ethics and the manner in which ethical dilemmas can be identified and resolved. It'll explore a number of specific themes that can be used to clarify the nature of ethical dilemmas affecting accountants. These will include aspects of financial accounting, (the pressures associated with creative accounting) auditing, (the need to report findings honestly), management accounting (the implications of setting unattainable budgets), and taxation (the extent to which tax avoidance can be justified).It'll provide students with a set of techniques with which to explore the dilemmas that will be introduced. These are necessarily philosophical in nature and cannot be regarded as objective or beyond challenge, but they do offer the means to subject a course of action to a rigorous analysis. 
Understanding Accounting Technologies & Institutional Structures, This class is concerned with the use of various social theories in the interrogation of the accounting profession and accounting practice. It begins with a general introduction to social theories in accounting in order to situate the different theoretical perspectives in relationship to each other. It then takes several modern and postmodern theoretical frameworks to evaluate the insights they may or may not offer to accounting practice, practitioners and students. Different historical methods are then developed and critiqued. The end section of the class reconfirms the importance of history and the lessons we can learn from it. The theoretical theme running throughout the class is based upon the 'linguistic-turn' in its various theoretical forms (ideology, discourse, semiotics and so on).

Intermediate Microeconomics, This is the core microeconomics class in second year. It aims to develop students’ understanding of: the concepts of consumer choice; the motives of the firm and profit maximisation; the market and its role in achieving equilibrium prices and quantities; and the implications of market power. It will introduce to students to mathematical techniques commonplace in economics, giving them the ability to apply these in a wider economic context.
Intermediate Macroeconomics & Data Analysis, The class builds upon the macroeconomic foundations established in the first year Economics class and both extends and deepens analysis. In particular this class will develop students’ ability to use key models used to analyse the determination of output in the short-run and in the medium-run. We will also cover some topics in the analysis of economic data including correlation and simple regression.
Topics in Microeconomics with Cross Section Econometrics, This class builds on the conceptual framework of Microeconomics 2 by introducing students to market imperfections through the lens of game theory. Game theory is an analytical toolbox that allows us to understand decision making in strategic environments and the class will provide students with a foundation in game theoretic reasoning.Thereafter, this class will study how market imperfections create a role for Government in markets. In doing so, we will investigate topics including taxation, education, and crime and punishment. This class will also look to explore some of these ideas empirically using cross section data. These empirical methods will open up a new route for students to understand the key taught economic ideas in a real world context.
Topics in Macroeconomics with Time Series Econometrics, The overarching aims of this class are: to extend students' knowledge and understanding of core macroeconomic models and of the econometric methods used to analyse macroeconomic data; and to develop their ability to apply these models and methods to address some key questions in macroeconomics. The class covers: economic growth; expectations, demand and policy; Europe: past, present, and future; and policy rules versus discretion. In addition, econometric methods covered include: regression; unit root testing; modelling volatility; cointegration and error correction.
Economics project, 
Applied Economics, In the third year econometrics class the student will have learned about regression in both a cross-sectional data and time series data context. This class extends that knowledge in three ways.First, for cross-sectional data, the class deals with regression techniques where the dependent variable may be restricted or limited in some way. In such cases, the regression model as taught in the third year class is not appropriate; EC413 develops models which are similar in spirit to the standard regression model, but can handle all of these cases.A second purpose of Applied Econometrics is to develop regression methods which can be used when you have panel data - consisting of both cross-sectional and time-series dimensions.Third, the class will build on the introduction to the econometrics of time series data developed in a previous class by developing two classes of models. One class consists of models that can accommodate multiple long run equilibrium relationships among a set of possibly non-stationary variables. A second class consists of methods for modelling volatility.
Advanced Microeconomics, Risk and uncertainty are ubiquitous in everyday life and they affect the way in which economic agents make their choices. This course will start analysing how modern economic theory deals with uncertainty and the way in which individuals makes their decisions under uncertainty. Attitude towards risk, decision-making under uncertainty, the role of insurance and financial markets will be covered in the first part of the course.The second part will present the foundation of the Economics of Information. Building on the first part of this course and on the game theoretic framework covered in Microeconomics 3, the study of Economics of Information will provide tools for the analysis of economic situations and contracting issues when either monitoring is imperfect or information is asymmetric.This class is intended to show how economic theory can be used to analyse individual behavior when information is not complete and decisions are risky. In particular, it will be applied to economic and business problems but also social interaction issues. In addition, the relevance of incentives and information in many economic environments will be highlighted, with particular emphasis on situations in which moral hazard and adverse selection problems arise.This course is useful in enhancing students’ understanding of other modules and will be of particular use in students’ dissertations. Moreover, students will gain key skills in strategic thinking and the analysis of information asymmetries that will be useful both in further study and employment.
Advanced Macroeconomics, This class aims to provide students with the required tools to understand current macroeconomic issues, such as: the interactions between the banking sector and monetary policy; or the policy responses to the global financial crisis. Throughout the class the analytical usefulness of the theoretical models taught is illustrated with real-world examples.
Labour Economics, This course will examine fundamental topics in Labour Economics. The primary goal is for you to learn how economists view the world of work and pay. The focus is on applications rather than theory. Topics include human capital and signaling, discrimination, the effect of technology on the wage structure, and income inequality. Along the way, you will gain insights into data analysis and empirical methods. These are highly marketable skills that tend to be entry requirements for consulting jobs, government work, and many other sectors.

Empirical Research Projects, For this project, you will be supplied with data relating to some issue in finance or accounting, and a preliminary list of hypothesis or questions to be addressed. You will be expected to expand the range of hypotheses to be considered and ways in which the hypothesis can be tested. Whilst all members of the class will consider the same issue the data sets will differ from one person to another.By providing the data, and a broadly defined research agenda, the research project allow considerably more time to be spent on the analysis of the data and interpretation of results than is feasible in the context of a more conventional dissertation. While the challenge of identifying a research topic and the development of an appropriate data set are to a large extent eliminated it does allow the analytical work to be developed in more depth. The introductory class will review briefly the analysis and techniques that will be relevant for the research work to be undertaken.
Financial Analysis of a Company, This project requires that you undertake a financial analysis of a company from the standpoint of a potential investor and provide an evaluation of the investment potential of the company’s shares. An assessment should be undertaken of the company’s financial position and performance on the basis of both its financial statements and stock market performance. The discussion should also bring out clearly the financial policies of the company and how these impact on the company’s performance. This will require an evaluation of its capital expenditure programme, the form of financing adopted by the company, including an evaluation of its capital structure and its sources of equity and debt funding. You should differentiate between the use of internal sources of funding, in the form of retentions, and the new issues of equity, and also discuss the company’s dividend policy to the extent that this is not covered by the discussion of its retention policy. In some companies it may be difficult to identify a consistent policy perspective on some of these issues – this can be documented and its implications assessed. The project should also provide an assessment of the company’s recent stock market performance to put the current share price into context. The returns achieved on the company’s shares should be evaluated using an appropriate benchmark as well as the standard market ratios – the earnings yield, dividend yield, etc. The final objective of the project is an assessment of the value of the company and the investment value of its shares. Even the most experienced and capable security analysts find this a very difficult task, even though they may be monitoring a company’s performance and prospects on a continuing basis. You are simply expected to build on the financial information and analysis you have undertaken to produce some tentative assessments of value. As the focus is on the use of financial information you are expected, firstly, to undertake a “fundamental analysis” of the company. Secondly, you are expected to use the various valuation models to provide insights into the determination of the company’s market value.For this project you will be supplied with data relating to some issue in finance or accounting, and a preliminary list of hypothesis or questions to be addressed. You will be expected to expand the range of hypotheses to be considered and ways in which the hypothesis can be tested. Whilst all members of the class will consider the same issue the data sets will differ from one person to another.

A world of strategic thinking awaits that will transform the way you think about making decisions! In many environments, decisions are not made in a vacuum: what any individual does affects the wellbeing of others, and vice-versa. When this is the case decision-making requires some very careful thought indeed. Game Theory recognises this inter-dependence of decisions, and through its study students will develop skills to analyse such strategic environments using appropriate game theoretic tools, enabling them to enhance their decision-making ability in environments where they face strategic adversaries. Whilst Game Theory is used extensively in Economics, it is also of great importance in the business environment whenever interactions take place at a strategic level.

Environmental Economics, A growing, and increasingly important, part of the work of many applied Economists includes the economic analysis of environmental issues. Additionally, many professionals working in the fields of energy, the natural environment, or business more generally will find that their careers require some working knowledge of economic approaches to environmental problems. The main objective of this class is to provide a thorough grounding in the economics of the environment, with a particular focus on environmental protection in an international policy context, such as climate change the loss of biological diversity.The main objective of this class is to provide a grounding in the economics of the environment. It demonstrates what economic analysis can contribute to discussions about the use of our natural capital (or environmental resource) base, and to discussions about policy responses to environmental problems.A key element of the economic approach to environmental policy is ‘value for money’ - designing policy interventions that give the greatest environmental improvement for any particular budget outlay. But economic analysis also deals with questions about sustainability (and so impacts on future generations) and equity between different individuals, groups, and countries.This class pays particular attention to international environmental problems. Such problems have been high on the agenda for environmental policy interventions since the Rio Summit of 1992, yet are ones that seem to be the most difficult to make progress with. We examine why this has been the case, making use of the growing literature on international environmental agreements.The class adopts a practical, applied orientation throughout.

Feminism & International Relations, This class aims to explore and assess contemporary feminist challenges to global politics.The last few decades have seen the emergence of a feminist movement world-wide in scope, transnationally connected, and working in and against international institutions to combat gender inequality. There is now a substantial feminist body of scholarship on global politics, interrogating the ostensible gender blindness of existing academic work in this area (particularly as articulated in the academic discipline of International Relations) and expanding the range of issues, ideas and voices that count as ‘global’ and ‘political’.This class considers feminism both as a lens on global politics and as a global political force. We begin our investigations by establishing key actors, in terms of the expansion and institutionalisation of feminist organising on a global scale and of feminist scholarship on global politics. We then discuss key feminist concepts and frameworks for making sense of global politics and the International Relations discipline, before critically evaluating feminist analysis of and activism on a range of substantive issues connected to conflict and security, international political economy and global governance. A final session will reflect critically on the impact of feminism on the theory and practice of global politics, and the challenges ahead.The class is taught in seminars encouraging active student participation and assessed solely through coursework intended to facilitate active and deep modes of learning.This class will begin by learning about context, in terms of the expansion and institutionalisation of the feminist movement on a global scale and the emergence of a feminist voice in the International Relations discipline.We'll then discuss conceptual, theoretical and methodological convergences and differences in feminist International Relations. A final seminar will reflect on the impact of feminism on both world politics and International Relations, and focus particularly on engagements and critique from the mainstream of the discipline.

The Therapeutic Relationship, This class provides you with an essential entry point into the person-centred approach, the core model of the course, and provides the theoretical framework to help you focus on the relational qualities which the course aims to develop, namely accurate empathy, unconditional positive regard, genuineness and therapeutic presence.
Personality Theory, You'll learn the theoretical foundations of the person-centred approach, including the nature of human function and dysfunction, as well as how people overcome their difficulties. You'll gain the conceptual tools to support your practice as a person-centred counsellor, leading to greater confidence and clarity in your work with clients.
The Therapeutic Process, You'll learn how to track your moment-to-moment working during counselling sessions. This ability to critically analyse practice is fundamental to effective, ethical work with clients. You'll also be asked to link within-session to broader person-centred theory.
Counselling Case Formulation, You'll develop the ability to work together with your clients to develop shared understanding of their difficulties, as these evolve over the course of therapy. This provides the basis for effective, reflective practice and also enables counsellors to communicate effectively with other mental health practitioners.
Counselling Practicum, You have the opportunity to put the other elements of the course into practice with real clients in a mental health treatment setting. The rationale is that the theory, skill development and personal development need to be integrated in practice. As well as in-course group supervision, the your practice is supported by external one-to-one supervision.
Counselling Research Dissertation, The aim of this class is to enable you to apply your knowledge and skills to a research project on some aspect of counselling. It involves training in counselling research methods and four options for research projects: quantitative, qualitative, systematic case study, or systematic review.
The Shape of Stories 1 (20 credits), The Shape of Stories 1 works with the bones of good stories across genre and form, resembling a seminar in format. This class introduces students to classic and contemporary writers and writing approaches that will be useful in future work. It also includes workshop time for students to share work with their peers and benefit from editorial feedback from tutors who are also published writers. We are mindful from day one that you are working towards the Major Project of your final Semester. The first semester is the time for planning and experimentation that will later be useful when tackling that Major Project.
The Writing Life (20 credits), The Writing Life is all about the contemporary literary landscape. It introduces students to the practicalities of a life in the creative industries – how writers make a living, and how that living is changing in the 21st Century. Through a series of talks and seminars from visiting speakers from across the writing worlds, students will have direct access to those who have been there and done it. In assignments, students will choose a target, for example, a publisher, a journal, an online magazine – then write a new piece of creative work to submit to that target, as well as an essay profiling the target they have chosen. This ensures students increase their knowledge of the publishing industry they wish to enter while also having a practical challenge, writing to a brief they have chosen themselves.
Research Skills in the Humanities (20 credits), Finally, Semester 1 also includes a Research Skills class which prepares students for how to work critically at an advanced level in the humanities, both in academia and the professional creative industries, providing an introduction to a crucial range of interdisciplinary research methods.These three introductory modules – one creative workshop, one industry-facing seminar series and one interdisciplinary research skills class – give our students the grounding they need to prosper. It also prepares them for what comes next.
The Shape of Stories 2 (20 credits), The Shape of Stories 2 is a partner to The Shape of Stories 1, the Semester 1 workshop focused on the bones of good stories across genre and form. This module takes that a step further, exploring hybrid writing across fiction, script, screenwriting, poetry and creative non-fiction, closely studying innovative contemporary works that blur the boundaries between different kinds of writing. Students will broaden their reading and experience, and will be encouraged to experiment with hybrid forms in their own creative work. From short stories containing to poetry, from ekphrastic responses to art and photographs to autobiographical, illustrated vignettes, The Shape of Stories 2 is an opportunity to explore new possibilities, in exciting ways.
The Made Project (20 credits), The Made Project consists of two assignments. The first is a short oral piece of creative work, which requires students to write to a time-limited brief then present that work to the group as a reading. The second is a more substantial creative piece chosen and developed in discussion with a course tutor over a number of weeks. Whether students intend to produce an adaptation of a piece of underlying material; or a response to an artwork in another form; or produce a work made in collaboration with another artist; or create and produce a podcast; or prepare and perform a piece for performance; students will—independently and in consultation with their nominated tutor—produce a piece of work with practical ‘made’ element. Students will be encouraged to produce work that adds diversity to their writing portfolio.
Advanced Topics in Creative Writing (Supervisions), Advanced Topics in Creative Writing seeks to build upon research and writing skills developed in Semester 1 while providing significant freedom for students to pursue any genre, form or approach to creative work that excites them. It enables students to work with a staff member on a mutually agreed topic within the broad field of Creative Writing, in fiction, poetry, script, non-fiction or hybrid forms.The student will be assigned a supervisor, after discussion with the convener, for the Advanced Topics module based on areas of interest, and will meet with that supervisor at least 5 times over Semester 2. The supervisor will identify a short initial reading list within a broad topic area and will meet with the student to discuss their reading of this literature and to assist in their development of a comprehensive reading list on a more tightly defined topic or debate identified by the student.Future meetings will be focused around key texts and questions identified by the student. The assignments consist of one major piece of creative work in any form or genre, influenced by the student’s reading list, and a shorter critical review of the initial reading list provided.
Narrative Processing across Languages, Culture and Media, Narrative processing is a field which has seen significant advances in recent years in psychology and neuroscience and narratology. These bodies of research converge on the many ways in which narratives across cultures and media can be seen to share universal features. However, there is an even older body of work, deriving ultimately from memory studies and developing through folklore and anthropology, which illustrates how narratives meaning and interpretation changes as it moves between social settings as well as media and cultures. This class invites students to engage with these three approaches, to form views on their implications for the use of narratives between cultural groups, and to consider potential practical applications for their findings.
Contemporary Scottish Cultural Studies, This class allows students to engage with materials from Scottish, cultural, historical and literary studies. Students will read a range of primary literary and cultural materials in a historical and theoretical context, and will develop skills in textual analysis and critical engagement. In doing so, the class will provide students with a knowledge of some of the main developments in Scottish literary and cultural studies throughout the 20th Century. Students will gain an understanding of the relationships between literature, culture and theories of nationalism, also developing an awareness of a range of major issues in contemporary Scottish culture.The class will allow you to engage with materials from Scottish, cultural, historical and literary studies.

Transcultural Fandom & British Popular Culture: Reading & Writing in Online Communities, This Masters option explores online fanfiction and fan communities and investigates how they work with and transform key popular texts and genres from British literary history. We will study reading and writing practices and consider questions of adaptation across cultures, in relation to texts and themes which may have a global presence across different forms of media. Fan studies is a growing area within media/cultural studies, and fanfiction studies is rapidly developing as a new field of exploration for literary scholars. We will read cutting-edge, as well as. canonical critical works in fan studies, and consider through this class how this field is developing and what new directions are emerging for research and scholarship. Students on this class are welcome to choose their own topics to explore, outwith the texts specifically covered in our classes.This class is suitable for anyone interested in learning more about transformative works and fan cultures: no prior knowledge of fanfiction or experience with fan culture is necessary. For students with a background in English studies and Creative Writing, it features questions about literary genre and form, about online writing communities and their readers, and about the global re-interpretation of British culture and literature. For students primarily focused on 'TESOL and Intercultural Communication', it offers opportunities to consider how fan communities enable language learners and use particular kinds of intercultural communication through shared knowledge of and admiration for a 'canonical' work. For students with a background in gender studies, fanfiction and fan cultures supply an extraordinarily rich source for investigating how gender is depicted, discussed and debated by a very large cohort of predominately female-identifying or LGBTQ+ fans.
Fleshy Histories: Meat Eating & Meat Avoidance, 1500 to the Present, This class will engage students with literary and historical materials, and with theoretical work from animal studies and ecofeminism. This will inform discussions about the place, meaning and function of meat eating and meat avoidance, and debates about human-animal relations, from the early modern to the modern world.As well as philosophical and religious work you'll read a range of primary materials, including literary works from A String of Pearls (aka Sweeney Todd) to Roald Dahl’s Pig; from Swift’s Modest Proposal to Coetzee’s Lives of Animals, via Dracula, and develop skills in textual analysis and critical and theoretical engagement.
The Major Project (60 Credits), The only module in Semester 3 is the triple module we call The Major Project. This is an extended piece of creative work in students’ chosen field, that they will develop with a supervisor who will get to know them and their work closely.The process starts with students sending an outline of their planned project for discussion with staff, before a supervisor is assigned to work with students regularly over the summer. This is the time for more focussed work on the page, and closer editing.Using the skills acquired in Semesters 1 and 2, students will now be fully independent researchers, ready to pursue their signature work which is intended to be a potential submission to an agent or publisher. Whatever form it takes, when students leave us, their work will be ready to present to the world at large. Novelists will make serious headway into their manuscript; poets and essayists and short story writers will amass the beginnings of a collection; screenwriters will have a full draft of a feature film or series pilot.
Criminal Justice & Penal Decision-Making, In this module we examine the moral and empirical bases of decision-making around the globe. How are traditional theories of justice being challenged, and what are the alternatives?  In the light of the international evidence, is it time for a re-think?  Illustrative topics include:legitimacydiscretionrehabilitation & desistancerestorative justicepublic attitudes to and knowledge of criminal justicethe trialaccess to justiceprosecution & defencesentencingparolerelease from prisoncommunity sentenceshuman dignityparticipationrightstherapeutic jurisprudencecriminal procedurepredictive justiceequalityreform & democratisationLearning is conducted through a range of methods including student-led debates, role plays, scenarios and simulations. The module is accompanied by visits to key institutions, including courts, prisons, new Third Sector projects, innovations such as the Drug Court as well as conferences with key practitioners and policy makers. 
Punishment & Processes of Penal Change, The western world’s “penal crisis” has, over the past thirty years, posed specific challenges to the reform tradition.In this module we explore the nature, dimensions and national permutations of that crisis, putative solutions to it and likely obstacles to their realisation. We draw on theoretical developments in the study of justice and punishment and explore their potential to illuminate and inform processes of progressive penal change.The module examines contemporary changes, international evidence and policy transfer, and technological challenges and considers reform across the globe. The module draws on insights and perspectives including law, the sociology of punishment, history and the social sciencesLearning is conducted through a range of innovative methods such as debates and media representations.

You'll be guided by some of the world’s foremost experts.
Restorative Justice, Restorative justice as applied to criminal harms, has grown and spread rapidly across the world in the last twenty years or so. Research indicates that in comparison with formal or retributive justice there can be more positive outcomes for both offender and victims. Yet the adoption of restorative justice within or alongside criminal justice systems has been patchy.Experience has shown that restorative justice is a popular topic and this module provides an opportunity for advanced learning. Your learning will be accompanied by practical exercises, such as simulations led by leading practitioners.
Childhood & Crime, Youth justice attracts interest across society, politically, socially and legally. Some issues – from the murder of two year old James Bulger in 1993 by two 10 year old children to the riots in 2011 in England – spark moral panic and demonstrate the extent to which such matters cut across disciplinary boundaries and influence legal and societal responses to children who offend.Youth justice generates its own philosophical approaches eg in the welfare / justice debate. It also provides a context within which to examine broader issues affecting criminal justice as a whole such as the need to balance the rights of the accused against the public interest.This class will provide an opportunity for you to critically examine some key aspects of youth justice law, policy and philosophy from a number of perspectives. Your learning will be supplemented by visits to custodial and innovative community settings, as well as a visit to and a simulation of Scotland’s unique system of ‘Children’s Hearings’ (a decision-making system based on the best needs of the child).
Surveillance, Technology & Control, Surveillance and the use of technology in criminal justice is becoming increasingly important.This module focuses on aspects of surveillance studies that inform the study criminal justice and penal change. If it's true that surveillance is ethically and politically problematic, how can or should it be used? Contemporary forms are stimulated by technological developments that were unavailable in earlier eras, whose deployment and consequences are, as yet, only beginning to be understood. Is increased surveillance inevitable? What is its impact on privacy and patterns of social exclusion? How can it be used for benign, even progressive objectives?The module focuses on theoretical understandings of surveillance, selected substantive aspects of it, patterns of resistance to it, and forms of regulation of it that have emerged in relation to it, including privacy and human rights concerns. Learning is supplemented by visits to the CCTV monitoring centre and Electronic Monitoring centre.

Stochastic Modelling for Analytics, This elective course will offer the students an opportunity to learn methods to analyse systems with uncertainty, as uncertainty modelling is key to a number of applications.This class introduces fundamental stochastic methods and techniques and then provides applications to large scale modelling. These methods are crucial for a better understanding of uncertainty and risk and these approaches are closely related to many important fields from forecasting to simulation.Problems from business, industry, and public policy motivate the use of stochastic modelling for analytical decision support.  The class will focus on two methodologies for supporting decision-making under uncertainty: stochastic agent-based modelling (ABM), a systems simulation method, and Bayesian belief network modelling (BBN). Agents-based models, also known as individual-based models in mathematical epidemiology, are often used to model infectious disease as well non-communicable disease and human behaviour. Agents may represent humans, institutions, organization, or any decision-making entities. ABMs can be used to project how macro-level order, patterns, and outcomes emerge bottom-up, from chance and actions and interactions of autonomous agents at the micro-level. An agent-based simulation (ABS) is an instance of a stochastic process.BBN provide a means of modelling causal relationships between variables. The BBN part of the module focuses on methods for learning model structures from empirical data to understand how inference mechanisms behave, how models can be validated and when this type of modelling is useful for decision support.
Business Simulation Modelling, The module will focus on the main two forms of business simulation:discrete-event simulation (DES)system dynamics (a continuous simulation technique)The class will provide a rational approach to simulation using a number of examples from manufacturing and service operations.The class will focus on the main two forms of business simulation:discrete-event simulation (DES)system dynamics (a continuous simulation technique)For DES, the class will start with an introduction, aiming to familiarise students with the concept and its use.

A variety of data collection/generation and analytical methods will be examined, and situated within different traditions/paradigms of social research.Throughout this class, we'll examine how these methods can be applied in students’ own research projects.This class provides an overview of the ever-expanding field of qualitative methods in political science, international relations and public/social policy.A variety of methods and analytical tools will be examined, and situated within different traditions of social research such as positivism and interpretivism. The focus is on both principles and practices. The idea is to develop an understanding of the logic and quality standards associated with different forms of qualitative inquiry, but also engage the practical tasks involved in conducting qualitative research. Rather than privileging one tradition as ‘more scientific’ or ‘more humanistic’ than the other, this class adopts an inclusive, pluralistic approach.The core assumption is that the complexity of the social and political world can be approached from multiple methodological perspectives, using a diverse set of tools. The common ground though is our strong commitment to the standards of systematic, rigorous social and political research.This class provides an overview of the ever-expanding field of qualitative methods in Political Science, International Relations and Policy Studies.

Welfare Concepts & Ideas, This class introduces students to some of the most important concepts which have shaped our understanding of social policy as an academic discipline, including such concepts as need, citizenship and entitlement, equality and justice, and happiness and wellbeing.It also looks at issues surrounding the governance and implementation of social policy and the variety of ways in which our needs for welfare provision can be addressed. We also look at some of the main theoretical perspectives which have informed the development of social policy, such as social democracy, liberalism, conservatism, feminism, environmentalism, Marxism and the New Right.The final part of the class looks at some of the main challenges facing social policy-makers today.Key concepts like liberty, equality and social justice have played a central role in shaping the development of the welfare state and still underpin contemporary political discussion of social policy.This course begins by exploring these concepts and then moves on to a range of both classic and contemporary theoretical perspectives, in particular, critical perspectives, that seek to evaluate and explain welfare arrangements.Bringing concepts and theories together, the last section of the course examines the three dominant traditions in social policy: social democracy; liberalism and conservatism.
Principles of Research Design, This class covers key research design issues and enables you to evaluate alternative research designs and create appropriate research proposals.

Supporting Teacher Learning (PG Cert), The course is aimed at those involved in the support of teaching professional learning at all stages of a teacher’s career including:student and probation mentorscontinuing professional development (CPD) coordinatorsprofessional review and development (PRD) reviewersschool leaderslocal authority officers with responsibility for CPD and/or probationer and leadership developmentIt recognises a widening conception that the role of the teacher includes not only a central role in supporting pupil learning, but also recognises the important role that teachers can play in supporting each other’s learning. Previously, it was assumed that by virtue of knowing how to teach children teachers had also been equipped to support their colleagues’ learning. However, there is growing recognition (Donaldson, 2011; Kennedy et al., 2008) that this important role requires additional specific knowledge, understanding and skills, which form the basis of this Postgraduate Certificate.You'll take three modules:How Teachers Learn20 creditsSets the scene, encouraging participants to think about how they learn, to reflect critically on different types of learning they have experienced across their personal and professional careers. It encourages the link between classroom pedagogies and pedagogies used for working with professionals, as such focusing in on the feedback loop between practitioners and students to support a metacognitive approach – closely related to the professional learning model. The assignment asks students to read around an area of interest, focusing on 3 representative articles, and to personally reflect on how these ideas influence their understanding of the theory and practice of teacher learning.Contemporary Contexts for Teacher Learning and Teachers' Work20 creditsBuilds on module 1 by facilitating a lens for looking at these pedagogies and experiences of teacher learning that reflects current policy and wider international education agendas. We also focus on the local influencers around community and student voice and what it means to engage in and with research when inhabiting a professional learning space. Throughout the module, students are supported to engage critically with education policy and the processes by which it is created; they are encouraged to question new education reform agendas. The students complete an assignment in two parts, firstly a poster presentation in which they critically analyse one key policy that they find particularly relevant to their own learning and/or professional learning in their setting, followed by a written reflection on the core ideas within the poster, supported by reference to academic literature and policy documents. Students are encouraged to engage with each other’s posters and provide collaborative peer feedback, which can be used to inform the critical reflection.Supporting Professional Learning in the Workplace20 creditsTakes the issues and skills developed in modules 1 and 2 and asks the participants to generate their own practitioner enquiry question, sensitive to their own setting, to support colleagues’ professional learning. The type of professional learning is open to the participant, but they are assessed on their rationale and through a practitioner enquiry approach supported in evaluating its success. Reflection is based on perceived successes of colleagues’ learning as well as their own learning when engaging in supporting others’ learning.Successful completion of all three modules gives GTCS Professional Recognition.Contact Kate Wall for more details.

It'll focus on applying research concepts and evidence to explain learning in practical situations. Topics include:Historical perspectives on learningThe behaviourist frameworkMemory and cognitionThe constructivist and social constructivist frameworkActive and situated learningThe role of knowledge transferMetacognitionNetworked learning and identityBiological perspectives on learning
Philosophy of Technology & Education, This module aims to enable students to develop a deep understanding of the philosophical issues raised by the understanding, affordances, and uses technology within education. The module will encourage substantive philosophical debate on a range of technologies and their application in education.The technologies that arise within educational practice today raise a set of important questions around the nature of the learning society and how learning and technology have become mutually defined, questions that are increasingly urgent in the context of the development of 'Scotland's Digital Future', a strategy to prepare Scottish society for technological change.Students in education need to understand how technological thinking shapes their practices if they are to become critical about the future direction of our technological and learning society. As technology is embedded ever more upon educational environments, the wider debates are increasingly urgent. As the world becomes increasingly globalised, and technologies employed more widely, the demand for courses of this nature is bound to increase.
Education & Self-Formation in Cultural Contexts, The module aims to enable students to identify, understand, and critically reflect on the ways the cultural sphere shapes and influences the (trans)formation of the self. With regard to the influence the cultural sphere has on personal development, there are two different perspectives that need to be reflected by those interested in the self-formation of the individual. On one hand, they need to reflect on the models of (trans)formative processes presented or maybe even prevalent in their own culture: How are educational processes depicted, understood, represented in modern culture, what characterises those processes in the eyes of the culture?On the other hand, it needs to be understood what models of personality are represented, and how those cultural representations actually influence those who live and grow within this specific cultural sphere. In providing the opportunity to engage with this kind of hermeneutic analysis, the module establishes the foundation of a conscious and reflected practice of educating and teaching as well as a basis for serious, far-reaching and interdisciplinary academic research within the field of Education Studies.The module attempts to add a more critical perspective with regard to the formative aspects of the cultural sphere and the structures of power inscribed in it. The need for this has been increasingly discussed within the international research community (Cultural Studies, Post-Colonial Studies, Gender & Queer Studies, Critical Whiteness, etc).
Putting Theory into Practice, This is the first of two optional work-based learning modules, available to students studying MSc Educational Studies.Students should expect to explore: How learning worksComponents of effective teachingWe will look at what we know from research about pupil engagement, interactions and questioning and assessment in contributing to effective learning and teaching. We will be reflecting upon the impact of different approaches. Students will identify an area for professional learning, to build up their own knowledge and understanding of an aspect of pedagogy. They will be encouraged to access research /theory perspectives around their chosen area to present on the implications for theory own practice from their learning.This is where students will consider the various components that contribute to effective learning and teaching and have a go themselves at building skills in these areas. They will be encouraged to implement what they have learned from their professional learning.Students will have the opportunity to plan, deliver and review episodes of learning, applying what they have learned about effective questioning and interactions in teaching as well as deploying formative assessment approaches to determine the success of their teaching sessions. Students will be encouraged to develop a professional learning plan to support their next steps, prior to the second module, professionalism and Professional Learning.
Professionalism and Professional learning, As part of the MSc Education Studies, this optional module will explore the professional roles of a teacher, as well as encouraging professional learning through practitioner inquiry. The module will run in Semester 2 following on from “Putting Theory into Practice” from Semester 1.Students will examine in a critical way the aspects of professional commitment and values, knowledge and understanding and skills and abilities build to form the identity of a teacher.  Students will explore what the aspects look like in practice and how the range of dispositions sit along with theory and practice.  We will look at what professionalism means for teachers in a range of contexts.  Students will be introduced to a model of Professional practitioner enquiry, and consider the place, purpose and principles underpinning this.The module will aim to:Provide creative spaces for students to practise evidence-based enquiry, to establish on-going proactive professional approaches Encourage students to be change agents, from evidence-based enquiryEncourage students to recognise the power of professional learning and enquirySupport students in critically reflecting on both theory and their own practice 
Alternative Education, This module addresses the growing trend towards provision of education outside the mainstream. The module invites students to reflect on education and its established norms, and to consider what makes education ‘alternative’ (and what is meant by ‘mainstream’). The module explores the rationale of ‘alternative education’ through a study of philosophies, practices and pedagogies that choose 'non-traditional' ways of thinking or practice in the realms of formal and informal education.The aim is to help learners recognise the existence of alternate education practices and understand why they are deemed so, and to enable learners to consider the implications, benefits and challenges of such classifications. This module will prepare students to explore the territory of alternative education, the various ways in which education gets labelled as alternative and look at learnings that could be useful to them as educators both in the formal or alternative spaces.
Philosophy of Technology and Education, This module aims to enable students to develop a deep understanding of the philosophical issues raised by the understanding, affordances, and uses technology within education. The module will encourage substantive philosophical debate on a range of technologies and their application in education.The technologies that arise within educational practice today raise a set of important questions around the nature of the learning society and how learning and technology have become mutually defined, questions that are increasingly urgent in the context of the development of 'Scotland's Digital Future', a strategy to prepare Scottish society for technological change.Students in education need to understand how technological thinking shapes their practices if they are to become critical about the future direction of our technological and learning society.

Creativity & Venture Planning, This class is important in terms of presenting an introduction for MSc students to the entrepreneurial process, from creative thinking to the development of a new business concept. This class has further thematic additions based on consultation with industry, specifically prototyping and storyboarding.
Mindset Lab, Mindsets are at the core of everything that people think and do. Therefore, if we want to steer entrepreneurial behaviour towards success, we need to start by shaping the mindsets of those who start ventures.  From government agencies to investment panels, entrepreneurial mindsets are quickly becoming the buzzword that everyone wants to know about.  But what are those mindsets? And when are they a force for good or otherwise?In this research-based class, you'll be exposed first hand to the daily struggles and successes of early-stage entrepreneurs and will be tasked with assessing their mindsets, how those mindsets are shaped by context and how, in turn, they shape the behaviour of the entrepreneur. You'll take a fascinating journey through the latest academic thinking on mindsets and will apply that thinking to the practice you observe in the entrepreneurs you will be following. Theory and practice will inform each other as you discover the often hidden power of the mind on human fears, goals, failures and achievements.

The module will consist of a selection of presentations and discussions around social innovation and social entrepreneurship.
Internationalisation & Growth, In today’s globalised business world, ventures often face international competition for inception, as well as being offered international opportunities from inception. Therefore, internationalisation is no longer the premise of larger, more established corporations. More and more often, firms internationalise early in their life cycle to explore and exploit business opportunities abroad and strengthen their competitive position in the domestic and foreign markets.The internationalisation and growth lab will provide participants with the tools and techniques required to found globally-oriented businesses from launch.
Disruptive Technologies, New technologies and scientific breakthroughs have the potential to ‘change the game’ for businesses, leading to new products and services.

This module explores the role of new technologies and innovation in different industry settings to critically analyse how SMEs can take advantage of disruptive innovation.
Virtual Incubator Project, The Virtual Incubator Project is the culmination of the programme. Here, you'll be expected to put into practice all of the skills and knowledge developed over the previous nine months in order to bring a business proposition to an investment panel. You're expected to identify a suitable business idea, use primary and secondary market research for validation, and demonstrate your ability to develop the infrastructure to operationalise and grow your business. It's an accelerated incubation program run in partnership with the Entrepreneurship Accelerator Hub at the Royal Bank of Scotland. Over the six-week period, you'll work to go from an initial idea to investable business opportunity. In weeks 4 and 6 you'll present a working proposal to different investor audiences with the final pitch in week 6 being delivered to the Scottish EDGE panel. During the incubation period, you'll occasionally have access to ‘hot-desk’ facilities at the Entrepreneurial Hub in the city centre, and we encourage you to network, learn and support the other entrepreneurs-in-residence. Most of the six-week period will be self-directed time for you to research and validate your ideas. Formal activities will predominately take place on Wednesdays, where you'll attend workshops, soundboard sessions with the academic team, and social events.

War, Sacrifice and the Nation in Europe, 1789-1918,         This class explores the changing concepts of death in war in the European conflicts between the French Revolution and the First World War. From being left on battlefields to being granted permanent resting-places and being remembered in war memorials, this period saw fundamental shifts in practices and attitudes towards soldiers’ death in war. Students will therefore analyse the efforts to create meaning for soldiers’ sacrifices and to inspire future generations to follow in their footsteps. The underlying themes of this class will be the emergence of national sentiment and national consciousness and the role of religion in concepts of sacrifice in war. The class will focus upon Europe (including Britain), but comparisons will also be made with the American Civil War, in which treatment of the war dead and memorialisation shifted fundamentally, prefiguring changes that were to occur with the Franco-Prussian War only a few years later.

The module is supplemented by visits to key institutions' prisons, women’s justice centres, as well as conferences with key practitioners and policy makers.
Childhood and Crime, Youth justice attracts interest across society, politically, socially and legally. Some issues – from the murder of two year old James Bulger in 1993 by two 10 year old children to the riots in 2011 in England – spark moral panic and demonstrate the extent to which such matters cut across disciplinary boundaries and influence legal and societal responses to children who offend. Youth justice generates its own philosophical approaches eg in the welfare / justice debate. It also provides a context within which to examine broader issues affecting criminal justice as a whole such as the need to balance the rights of the accused against the public interest. This class will provide an opportunity for you to critically examine some key aspects of youth justice law, policy and philosophy from a number of perspectives. Your learning will be supplemented by visits to custodial and innovative community settings, as well as a visit to and a simulation of Scotland’s unique system of ‘Children’s Hearings’ (a decision-making system based on the best needs of the child).
Surveillance, Technology and Crime Control, Surveillance and the use of technology in criminal justice is becoming increasingly important.This module focuses on aspects of surveillance studies that inform the study criminal justice and penal change. If it's true that surveillance is ethically and politically problematic, how can or should it be used? Contemporary forms are stimulated by technological developments that were unavailable in earlier eras, whose deployment and consequences are, as yet, only beginning to be understood. Is increased surveillance inevitable? What is its impact on privacy and patterns of social exclusion? How can it be used for benign, even progressive objectives? The module focuses on theoretical understandings of surveillance, selected substantive aspects of it, patterns of resistance to it, and forms of regulation of it that have emerged in relation to it, including privacy and human rights concerns. Learning is supplemented by visits to the CCTV monitoring centre and Electronic Monitoring centre.

Management of Innovation, To stay ahead of the game, corporations must innovate. They must improve their processes, launch new products and services, move into adjacent markets, and even launch breakthrough new businesses. There is just one problem; organizations are not built for innovation, they are built for ongoing operations. Furthermore, innovation and ongoing operations are always and inevitably in conflict. So, how can corporations achieve simultaneous excellence in both?The central focus of this class is innovation implementation. The importance of the subject matter covered in this course is captured in the widely accepted “truism” that over 90 percent of businesses (as well as non-profit organizations) flounder on the rocks of implementation; either the 'plans' never come into being or get distorted, or the implementation is much costlier and time consuming than anticipated. However laudable the creative idea or innovation intentions may be, if they do not become a reality, they usually are not worth the paper on which they are written. Conversely, high-performing companies excel at execution. This class will provide concepts, frameworks, and tools to help the participant to gain that “execution advantage” while innovating.

Making & Unmaking British Literature 1880 - 1950, The class will allow you to engage with materials from Scottish, Irish and English historical, cultural, and literary studies. It will explore the formation of the idea of a national British literature at the end of the nineteenth-century, and its rapid disintegration with the pressures for devolution and independence in early-twentieth century Ireland and Scotland.The class will focus on key moments, of economic depression, rebellion, and war, at which the ideas of a unified national culture were put under particular stress.You'll read a range of primary literary and cultural materials in a historical and theoretical context, and will develop skills in textual analysis and critical engagement.
Narrative processing across Languages and Cultures, Narrative processing is a field which has seen significant advances in recent years in psychology and neuroscience (eg Zwaan, situation models) and narratology (eg Ryan and transmedia narrative).These bodies of research converge on the many ways in which narratives across cultures and media can be seen to share universal features. However, there is an even older body of work, deriving ultimately from Bartlett's memory studies, and developing through folklore and anthropology, which illustrates how narrative meaning and interpretation changes as it moves between social settings, media and cultures (Bauman, Barber).This class invites you to engage with these three approaches critically, to form views on their implications for the use of narratives between cultural groups, and to consider potential practical applications for your findings.
Introduction to Intercultural Communication, This class critically applies the linguistic theory of communication, and theoretical approaches to culture, to a range of problems in intercultural communication. We explore what a culture is, and whether cultures differ systematically. We learn about the linguistic theory of communication, and approaches to discourse and conversation, and speech acts, including ways in which these differ between cultures.We consider how face and politeness can be theorized, and how they differ between cultures. We look at how languages differ, and whether differences in language lead to differences in thought. We look at the self, and identity, and their relation to culture and cultural difference, and we see how mobilities relate to intercultural communication.This class is relevant for those who aim to teach English to speakers of other languages who need to understand issues around intercultural communication. It is also relevant to those studying literature who want to understand how communication works, particularly in the culturally complex situations in which literature can arise.The class critically applies the linguistic analysis of discourse, conversation and other types of verbal behaviour, in the context of a theoretical understanding of the communication of meaning. We will look at languages in contact, the relation between language, culture and thought, and other theoretical and practical issues in the understanding of intercultural communication.

International Institutions and Regimes,         The purpose of this class is to provide students with a comprehensive overview of the concepts and theoretical approaches central to understanding and analysing the role of international institutions and regimes in the contemporary world. This class will survey a variety of international institutions and regimes, exploring how they shape global interactions in a number of cross-cutting issue areas such as security, trade, human rights and the environment. The overall analysis will contribute to the understanding of the theories, practices and processes through which global politics are organised and to an assessment of the future of international institutions and regimes in global governance.    International organisations (IOs), like the World Trade Organisation, the United Nations, NATO, or the European Union have become common place in how governments govern their international relations. IOs are often seen as the solution to international cooperation problems, be it in areas of conflict, trade, human rights, or the global environment. Whether IOs can live up to this promise and can indeed change national governments' behaviour to solve global cooperation problems will be the central question this course addresses. Specifically, we will examine why IOs differ in their rules and decision-making processes and how this variation translates into different policy outputs and outcomes. The first part of the class builds the theoretical and analytical foundation to address these key questions in a principled manner across different policy domains, while the second part applies these insights to specific IOs. We will discuss prominent IOs, such as the World Bank, IMF, or NATO together with newer forms of transnational governance as well as international courts.
Feminism and International Relations,         This class will begin by learning about context, in terms of the expansion and institutionalisation of the feminist movement on a global scale and the emergence of a feminist voice in the International Relations discipline.

Students will develop an understanding of geochemical thermodynamics, an understanding of different weathering processes and the impacts of environmental pollution on the lithosphere and hydrosphere.
Structural health monitoring, The course aims to provide the fundamentals of health monitoring of civil structures, and includes the following topics:the logic of structural identification based on sensor observationsan overview of sensor technologies for civil applications, with focus on accelerometers, strain gauges, thermocouples, fiber-optic sensors and wireless sensorsnumerical methods for signal processing and data analysisanalysis of case studies, including bridges, buildings and heritage structures
Industrial design & construction, Graduates increasingly need highly developed transferable professional skills to prepare for and to gain future employment. This module allows students to design and construct field scale civil engineering structures. Approval of students being able to take this module would be done on case-by-case basis by MSc course leaders as an individualised learning contract.
Rock Mechanics, Tunnelling and Groundwater, The class aims to provide you with an understanding of sub-surface geology and rock mechanics and its influence on the engineering design of slopes and tunnels. You’ll gain an overview of groundwater flow through soil and rocks, and will be introduced to techniques for the in-situ measurement of permeability and methodologies for site investigation in dewatering projects. In the class we look at geological CO2 storage from a rock mechanics perspective, using the world-leading Aquistore project in Canada as a case study.
Waste management & landfill design, This class introduces students to the organisational and regulatory aspects of waste management practice in the UK: legislation, composition of domestic and industrial wastes, storage, collection, reception, and disposal of solid wastes, clinical wastes, sewage sludge disposal, recycling and recovery.
Public health studies, This class aims to assist students in the fuller understanding of Public Health, the factors affecting it and the role of Public Health Professionals as part of a multidisciplinary team in taking preventative and proactive action in safeguarding the health of the public.
Leading issues in circular economy, The module introduces circular economy as a framework for the development and management of a sustainable 'waste-as-resource' economic system. The implications of the concept for transformations towards sustainability are explored in detail.
